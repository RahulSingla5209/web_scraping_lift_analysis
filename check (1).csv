0,"March 24, 2002 10:54PM",merc1,"I personally think that with a few tweaks the C320 could also sit at the top of this group. It's still more of a entry-level luxury sedan than Mercedes would lead you to believe. The C320 ""Sport"" needs to have it's suspension retuned to accept 17 inch tires without a harsh ride. MB also needs to stop forcing metal trim and black leather on everyone that wants the sport package. The C240's 6-speed wouldn't hurt either if offered on the C320, though it needs to be ""fixed"" first.

That said, my favorite of the group is (gasp!) the new A4 3.0. The A4 easily has the best interior of any sub-40K car, combine that with stunning looks and a body that is as rigid as any ever made and you have my personal favorite. The single thing I don't like about the A4 is the grey trim around the bottom of the car. This trim doesn't match any of the body colors, as it should be body color anyway. This is an excellent car and in my opinion the best there is under 40K. The upcoming A4 Convertible, Coupe and S4 WILL all be winners.

The BMW 330i is now an old favorite, but I'm (of all people) starting to tire of the 3-Series just a bit, save the M3 variants. I was kind of dissappointed by the 2002 facelift, they could have done a little more in the way of styling. I hope they do a little more for 2003 with the coupe models.

The Acura TL-S is easily my favorite fwd car in this class. Wonderful engine (you actually can hear it) and decent handling for a front driver. Nice price, seats and what not, not hard to see why the TL is so popular. This car's main faults are styling and obvious cost-cutting in the interior, stereo, fake wood etc. Otherwise a standout.

Lexus ES300. Nice, but not my type of car at all. This is one for the Buick set. The IS300 is half baked, but has a wonderful chassis. Styling is also in question here, it simply doesn't look like a 35K car (grown). The interior is gawd-awful. Bet on the next IS300 being done right from the start. In their defense Toyota didn't initially intend for this car to be sold in the U.S. so it was a rush job.

The CTS holds the greatest unrealized potential here. I've seen several now, and each time I see one they look better and better. Again like the C320, IS300 the car has interior issues. The dash feels like it was made by Rubbermaid. If you're going to be stingy with wood trim, why bother? Half of the steering wheel in wood, and very little anywhere else in the car??? The seats are very good though, as is the handling. A work in progress.

The G35 looks like it may have a winning chassis, but the interior, though clean looking seems to be styled about 10 years ago, lots of square shapes and flat surfaces. Another great engine, waiting to drive this one.

Don't really care much for the X-Type. If I were a Jaguar man I'd be truly pissed at Ford and Jaguar for this one. They are actually selling a fwd X-Type in England and I've read where they're thinking about selling it here! Hell no. The car should have been rwd not awd. Some will tell you that this was done to compete with Audi. Thats BS, awd was the only way to keep the car from being fwd, WITHOUT spending the money to convert the car to rwd. It is a good looking car though and that Jaguar ""leaper"" will be enough for some, but this car has to grow on me.

The Chrysler 300M is about as close to an Audi that American cars come. This new 300M ""Special"" is truly a good looking car inside and out. One problem: Where is the performance???? A 255hp car *in this class) with a 0-60 time over 8 seconds is not accpetable. Something is not right here. Some say engine, transmission and/or gearing, but whatever it is, Chrysler needs to let some MB engineers have a look at this car. The heavier E320 with less power is faster. I still like this car, but it's no lust object once you get past the great styling.

1,"March 25, 2002 12:06AM",fredvh,I am debating a new purchase and these two are at the top of my list. The price difference between these two is approx. 6K (non-Type S Acura). Is the ES300 worth 6K over the TL? I don't know because I have never owned a TL but I am familiar with the ES300(previous generation). Supposedly the 2002 ES300 is a lot better than the previous generation but is it that much better than the TL? Of great importance to me is initial quality and overall dependability. Does the TL compare with the ES300 in both of these categorys? I am not familiar with the Honda Co. Are prices lower than Lexus for service work? I would appreciate any input on this dilemma from some TL owners.

4,"March 25, 2002 5:44PM",riez,"One beauty of BMW 3 Series is that there are so many models to choose from. Almost half of all buyers in America don't get the basic RWD 4 door sedan. Besides having 3 engine and 3 transmission choices, you can get coupe, convertible, AWD, station wagon, and super-high performance M-Series!!!

hungrywhale... I concur that having the availability of a manual transmission across the line is absolutely critical!!!"
5,"March 26, 2002 1:20PM",blueguydotcom,"good grief, so you wait 9 months for the manual. Even with an auto, I prefer to every car listed and I NEVER have owned an auto and never thought I'd enjoy driving a car with an auto. That's what value, performance and an exceptional engine can do for a car. Once the G has a stick there is not another sedan under the M3 that I'd consider."
6,"March 26, 2002 2:02PM",hungrywhale,"I'll give it a fair shot when the manual comes out, but I'm just flat-out not interested in an auto. I don't care how fast it is. It's not about the speed, it's about the driving experience and having more control over the car."
7,"March 26, 2002 2:45PM",blueguydotcom,"I understand it's not about the speed. I really don't care if the car won't do over 100 as I rarely break the century mark. What I do care about is power and with the manual mode on the auto, I can get it when I want it. Will I buy an auto-equipped G? In all likelihood, no. I desperately want to drive the 6 speed."

Infinity G35(Tons of BFTB, good luxury, but completely boring exterior and even more boring of an interior)

BMW 325(very little BFTB, excellent handling/build quality/resale, classy looking but too conservative for me)

Riez, I read from your profile that you have a manual BMW 5-series. But I think you are wrong to not consider a car such as a Infiniti G35 to be a serious contender as a performance luxury sedan. From your logic, then the BMW 3-series (your wife's) or the 5-series with the Steptronic should not be contenders either. That's belittling the Infiniti, Audi, Lexus, Acuras, BMW's etc. with automatics.

When I return in December from Qatar, I plan on purchasing a sports sedan. I'm leaning on the G35, but the BMW 330i along with the Audi S4 are also contenders. IMO, if the handling of the Infiniti is as good as the BMW as some that drove it has stated, then it will hard to pass up especially for the price. Also my first choice will be a manual, and Infiniti should have the manual out by December. I will test drive all three, manual and automatics, and make my choice from there.

I do agree with you that manuals are more fun to drive, and that will be my first choice. But, automatics in this category, especially those made by BMW, Infiniti and others, should not be eliminated as performance sedans. Different flavors for different people.

I have been following discussions on many boards and what I have been noticing is that there is so many ""experts"" on what is the best sports sedan. And most haven't even driven the competitors to give an honest opinion. This is not aimed at you Riez or Shipko, because your profiles states that you own a BMW already. But from what I noticed is that some BMW ""supportors"" don't even own a BMW, (at least not from their profile) or they state that they never drove an Infiniti G35, but they still make ""unsupported"" facts, assumptions or opinions on such. (See the Edmund's BMW 3-series discussion). I hope in your defense, Reiz, that you drove the automatic Infiniti G35, to give an opinionated statement that it doesn't classify as a performance sedan. I value your opinion and others as well.

Again, I'm not flaming you, but I try to be an informed consumer before I buy anything. That is the reason that I will drive every car that I'm interested in and make my choice from there. I'm also always interested in those opinions from people that own the type of car I'm shopping for and at least drove it, so they can give valid pro/negative statements.

Cheers!"
13,"March 27, 2002 10:00AM",hungrywhale,"I think what riez and I are trying to say is not that automatics perform poorly or that only weenies drive them

But any car that truly holds itself out as a performance sedan NEEDS at least the option of a manual tranny. Manuals are always faster than automatics and they are almost always the choice of the enthusiast driver.

There's nothing at all wrong with automatics, but I sure don't want one."

15,"March 27, 2002 11:23AM",dave330i,"In this class, the best bang for the buck has to be IS300, assuming one can live with the styling.

I guess I'm one of the few that likes the old A4 styling to the new. Isn't the new A4 pushing 3600 lbs. now? That's pretty heavy for this class."
16,"March 27, 2002 12:06PM",blueguydotcom,"Even at 29k for a 35k msrp IS300, I passed on it. Now I never drove a manual one (they weren't out yet) but even with a manual, given the car's horrible drive-feel, poor interior and lethargic steering, I don't think I'd go near one. They're not up to Audi/BMW/MB/Infiniti."
17,"March 27, 2002 1:42PM",wishnhigh1,"Never liked a lexus, and probably never will. I would rather drive the CTS. There is always something that irritates me about them. I would buy the IS as a Toyota but not a Lexus...I personally think Lexus should have a car in its lineup with this cheap of an interior and with this much sporting character. Toyota deserves something like it though.

Also, I don't think 215 horsepower for 29k is a lot of bang for the buck, considering the G35 is the same price with 260 horsies."
18,"March 27, 2002 1:46PM",dave330i,"""I would buy the IS as a Toyota but not a Lexus""

How else are they going to get that extra $5k from you then?

Reasonably equipped G35 goes for $33k or so."
19,"March 27, 2002 2:10PM",riez,"I couldn't have said it better myself. I'll let you lead services!

mbarto... I most certainly will test a G35 manual if and when it finally comes out. I promise!!! Automatics make nice luxury sedans and maybe even sporty luxury sedans. But NOT performance sedans or luxury performance sedans. (I don't even consider the 540iA Sport truly worthy, though it is as close as one can get in an automatic. If I could just get my wife to drive a manual....)"
20,"March 28, 2002 12:43AM",mbarto,"Thanks Riez! Let me know when you do. I'm sure you'll get a chance before I will since I won't return until December. I am curious of how it compares to the BMW's. YOU can speak from experience, so I'll value your opinion.

It does make a difference being married. (LOL! see the latest discussions on the Infiniti G35 vs BMW 330i board). First, I'm fortunate to have a wife that can drive a manual. Not that she prefers that, her first choice is an automatic. But she appreciates the hard work and sacrifice I'm doing out here, and knows that this car is for me first, family second. Of course, it helps my cause when I let her buy a new dining room set last month, and new living room drapes this month. Bribes do help! Whatever I finally decide, I'm sure she'll be happy."
21,"March 28, 2002 5:07PM",riez,"mbarto... As regards the ""bribes"" issue, you've figured out one of life's great truism: You get what you want so I can get what I want."""
22,"April 5, 2002 3:34PM",cybersol,"So if someone were looking to purchase a new performance luxury sedan today, what cars would they HAVE to take a look at and test drive? Lets say they only had time to look at five?

What five would they have to look into?"
23,"April 5, 2002 5:16PM",riez,"Since it has to have a manual transmission and should be RWD (AWD/4WD adds too much weight and complexity) and has to be fun to drive hard...

1. BMW 3 Series manual
2. Lexus IS300 manual
3. Cadillac CTS manual
4. Lincoln LS6 manual

If you want affordable and can go FWD, then add Nissan Maxima 6-speed with LSD and maybe Altima 3.5SE 5-speed.

Try to get car with LSD. Inline 6s are magnificently smooth engines.

Possible future car: Infiniti G35 sedan when it finally gets the 6-speed manual."
24,"April 7, 2002 8:22AM",coolguyky7,"The TL should be up for redesign in a few years so a TL would be outdated in the not so far future. And besides, it seems like everyone who drives an Acura drives the TL. I LOVE the ES300. Some say it looks bloated; I don't think it does. At the 3/4 angle, it looks impressive. The interior is as nice as a car can get. If I had the money, I would buy an ES300 in a heartbeat. I never did like the past ones' boring styling...especially since the last two generations were nearly twins. Go with the ES. Besides, Lexus' quality is ahead of Acura's."
25,"April 7, 2002 3:59PM",kdshapiro,"The new ES is a very smart looking car. Notwithstanding any engine issues though, I think there are direct price competitors like the I35 that offer better overall value on paper. Now I haven't driven either new model, I did drive the older ES300 and it did it's job very well. They are both great cars. Lexus for legendary reliability and resale value, Infiniti for up-to-date features."

28,"April 9, 2002 2:43PM",blueguydotcom,"Go drive one. They're a blast and for the money they're a steal. If someone wants entry level performance luxury at a great price, the G's really tough to beat.

29,"April 11, 2002 3:06PM",steffie2jc,"I can't make a decision. I was set on the MB C240 but then I read some postings from people who got lemons. Now I am starting to think that the Audi 3.0 CVT front wheel drive is what I shoud get. Any advice? Low manintenance is what I am looking for.
Thanks!"
30,"April 12, 2002 7:53AM",merc1,"Well I'm a Benz fan first and foremost, but the A4 3.0 CVT just offers more for the money. The A4 has a better interior, the top A4 engine (compared to the C240, which is the base C) and it's styling is at least as good as the Benz if not better. Both makes pay for scheduled maint during the warranty period. Neither car will be ""low maintanence"" after the warranty runs out, especially the Audi with it's fairly different transmission. If you're priced these cars and they've come out equal go for the Audi it's the better value here.

M"
31,"April 14, 2002 1:09AM",popovs,"I think both are excellent(sp?) cars, however neither one is a low maintenance automobile. That is to say neither brand is known for low maintenance. What they do offer is luxury and performance in an aesthetically pleasing package and, some would argue, a superior ownership experience.

As someone has said before, every manifacturer makes lemons - some more than others - but the internet is not the best place to find information about that. Most people are just venting and are not representative of the owner community.

Although I can not speak as to the driving merits of the cars, I suspect that they are similar since I've heard (read) good things about both the A4 CVT and the C240. Something to keep in mind is that anytime a new product is offered by the industry, it usually takes a couple of years for the company to work out all the bugs in the technology.

Both cars are relative newcommers to the market. The facts that they are made by distinguished companies and use proven powerplants does not speak conclusively as to how reliable the cars will be as a whole.

Since you are already looking for alternatives to the MB because of reliability concerns, it may be worth your time to look at other alternatives than the Audi. As someone has suggested in the Help me Choose! forum, try looking to Lexus for the answer. They seem to make reliable cars that are also cheap to keep running. Of course now we get into the issue of European vs Asian luxury ..."
32,"April 17, 2002 2:23AM",popovs,"It has come to my attention that as of late MB has taken a hit in its reputation. People have been quick to point at the recent survey results - both European and Domestic - that say Mercedes is no longer reliable. These surveys show that statistically speaking MB has as much as doubled the amount of repairs that they do under warranty. I won't deny these findings, but I will try and justify them.

1st and foremost, MB has and is comming out with newer designs every year, updating the cars both inside and out. Anytime that a new product makes its debue it takes a couple of tries to get all the kinks worked out.

Secondly, according to mbspy.com, Mercedes accounted for ~half of the profits by DCX last year. I think MB is being used as a cash cow to keep Jeep and Co affloat, thereby driving Mercedes to cost-cutting through corparate pressure. Lower quality parts equal lower overall car quality.

These two should get things going ... Feel free to agree or disagree."
33,"April 17, 2002 12:37PM",mvargo1,"There is not much to debate on this subject. If you want a reliable car you buy Japanese. If you want a drivers car you used to have to buy european. The Japanese just do quality better and more consistantly than anyone else. You also get a lot more car for your money with a Japanese vehicle. There was a time when the europeans built the best driving cars in the world. Sadly for them those days are passing. The Japanese keep building cars that are closer and closer to european driving dynamics (IS and GS series Lexus(Lexi?), and Q45 and G35 Infiniti's) While the europeans quality especially Daimler/Chrysler just is not keeping up."
34,"April 17, 2002 1:11PM",wishnhigh1,gave up nationality based generalizations a couple of years ago.
35,"April 18, 2002 4:12PM",cybersol,"I'm interested more towards performance than luxury. Also value is an important component for me. Although I have the money to buy these cars, I also have other fun things and places to spend it. I'm looking to buy the car and keep it for around 7-10 years. Its very sunny with no snow here as well. I also want an automatic or CVT(gasp).

So right now, the five I am going to look at more closely are as follows:

1) BMW 330i
2) Audi A4 3.0 CVT
3) Infiniti G35
4) Acura TL-S
5) Nissan Altima 3.5 SE

The BMW represents the top of the class, but it also has the highest price. The Altima represents the most performance oriented family car, which is a cheaper class of cars. The BMW and Altima will bracket the value equation. The other three all have the potential to compete for my dollars.

Cars that are missing, IS300 too small, while the styling of the CTS, S60 T5, and 9-5 Aero are not for me. The ES300 and I35 don't have enough performance for me. Everything more expensive than a comparibly equipped 330i was also excluded.

What do you guys think? Anything missing?

Thanks,

36,"April 18, 2002 4:50PM",riez,"cybersol... I can't fathom why you would want to go with slushbox, but that is your loss.

Comparing FWD to RWD is like apples to oranges.

Not sure what sort of real price range you are looking at. The 330i with options might push $40,000. You might really consider the much less expensive 325i. An Altima 3.5SE with few options might have a $25,000 MSRP.

Read Motor Trend's review of I35. Their's had more than enough performance. 0-60 mph in 7.0 seconds, fastest in their comparison test. And it can be had with a Sport Package. But you might be better off with a loaded Maxima SE or GLE, saving thousands off the I35.

You might also consider Volkwagen Passat. That can also be had with AWD. If you like AWD, the Jag X-type should be on your list.

From the domestic corner, you might also consider a Lincoln LS 6 or 8. Or Chrysler 300M.

Surprised your list excludes the Mercedes-Benz C-class.

And if you can live with a FWD automatic, a loaded Camry or Accord V-6 or Avalon might be acceptable near the Altima's price range."
37,"April 18, 2002 6:07PM",cybersol,"Sorry to disappoint with the slushbox, but if we were all the same life would be boring (and there would only be 1 car type).

I would prefer RWD, but the best FWD's (torque sensitive steering) are getting close enough to bring the acceptable price premium for RWD down. Price range is 25-40K as you mention.

Passat, 300M, 325i, are too slow for me. The C Classes are either too slow or more expensive than the BMW. I would choose the BMW over the X-type, as they are similarly priced and I live in sun country.

The maxima (better value than the I35) is a good suggestion, and I am considering that equally with the Altima at the lower end.

My wife loves Camry's, but I'm looking for excitement. slushbox or not.

Thanks,
cybersol"
38,"April 18, 2002 7:14PM",kdshapiro,"The new Altima is great as my friends just bought one. However, dollar for dollar I think the Maxima is the over-all winner for a FWD car. If you can live without the amenities of the I35 the GLE with leather, sunroof, BOSE can't be beat. I've owned two Maximas. Me! I recently made the jump to the 330i, and it's been worth every penny. However the G35 owners are very passionate about their choices. For a couple of dollars more than the Maxima, hovering around the I35 I guess, the TL-S can't be beat either.

I understand when it comes down to it, you pick what you think has the right combination of value, performance, luxury and the right type of car for you. For every person it is different. When I got the BMW I was cross-shopping SUVs, mini-vans, and FWD passenger cars to see what struck my fancy, and I was ready to get an Explorer."
39,"April 18, 2002 7:18PM",riez,"cybersol... Excitement and slushbox don't seem to be compatible. I can't get too excited about FWDers. Certainly not a slushbox FWDer.

Not sure what you mean about ""the best FWDers (torque sensitive steering)"".

Very powerful FWDers tend to suffer from severe torque steering. Use of equal length half-shafts and limited slip differential can help, but not completely eliminate. The laws of physics remain. When the drive wheels and steering wheels are one and the same, and you have a powerful motor, you'll get some torque steering.

Do you have kids? Plan to in near future? If not, have you considered any coupes or convertibles? They can be a bit more exciting."
40,"April 19, 2002 8:28AM",dave330i,"""Excitement and slushbox don't seem to be compatible.""

Agreed. Unfortunately, most American drivers don't seem to get it. They care about silly stuff like 0-60, 1/4 mile, hp & torque numbers, but choose to miss out on the fun part of driving."
41,"April 20, 2002 1:18AM",cybersol,"Riez, you have heard of speed sensitive steering? This varies the power steering boost as with the speed. Acura claims to have torque sensitive power steering on the TL-S (not the TL though). This would supposedly vary the power steering boost with the torque being applied. And that in theory could eliminate a large amount of torque steer found in powerful FWD cars. It still doesn't eliminate the FWD tendency to under steer due the the drive wheels being the same as the turning wheels."
42,"April 20, 2002 9:49AM",riez,"cybersol... There are two types. Those tied to engine output and those tied to road speed. I have heard that the latter are superior, since you can vary engine speeds (RPMs) a lot, depending upon gear being used and speed, even while driving relative steady speeds. Better systems vary boost on road speed, since you normally need more assist at low speeds, regardless of engine RPMs.

Here is all that the lengthy full-color TL brochure says: ""Steering: Variable Power-Assist Rack-and-Pinion"". This is off the tech specs on page 30. I cannot find a single mention of the steering system anywhere else in the brochure. So if Acura thinks its variable assist power steering system is special, they are keeping it a secret. This large brochure covers both the TL and TL Type S."
43,"April 21, 2002 12:36AM",cybersol,"Yeah, I have that brouchure and they don't mention the difference between the TL and TL-S, though they say both have variable power assist. They do not say how it varies.

But on the Acura website. TL -> Specifications -> Body/Suspension/Chassis it says:


Steering Type

TL Type S - Torque-sensitive, variable power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering

3.2TL - Speed-sensitive, variable power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering


Here's the link if you want to check it out:

http://www.acura.com/model_TL/tl_spec_results.asp


Hard to find, but not a secret."
44,"April 21, 2002 6:50AM",riez,"cybersol... From what I've read, the better variable power assist system is tied to road speed, not engine RPMs. Once you get a car up to 25 mph or more, there isn't much need for assist, even if your RPMs decline due to turning or downshifting. And certainly once you hit 45 mph or more there isn't much need for assist no matter what happens to your RPMs.

But keep in mind that torque steering isn't due to the steering system. It is due to other factors. Can be very pronounced in powerful FWDers. Corrective actions include limited slip differentials and equal half-shafts. Need to provide equal power simultaneously to drive wheels.

From standing start, floor your car. See if the wheel pulls in one direction. You'll have to correct with the steering wheel (to keep the car straight) but by then you'll have already encountered the torque steering. You can also notice it if you are aggressively accelerating in a curve. Wheels pull you out of your intended direction and you have to correct."
45,"April 24, 2002 7:51AM",beartrax79,"So, if you read through most of this group, alot of references went out to Audi... give a guy a hand here and compare an Audi A4 3.0 to an Audi S4... I see a difference of about $5K, 30hp, and a sporty suspension. Why shouldn't I load up a 3.0, rather than going after the S4?

Oh, and does anyone know on possible improvements for one or the other for 2003?"
46,"April 24, 2002 5:15PM",cybersol,"Have you driven them both? The S4 really moves. Even by Audi's own 0-60 times the S4 manual is 1 second faster and the S4 tiptronic is 1.2 seconds faster.

Yet, the S4 is currently based on the 2001 A4 platform, and it is scheduled to be upgraded to the new platform in the 2003 model year. Expect the performance difference to increase as the indications are that the new S4 will pack 300 or more hp.

Hope this helps."
47,"April 25, 2002 12:36PM",beartrax79,"I've tested the 3.0, not the S4. Hmmm... new S4 in '03, huh? Maybe I should just wait. What do you think, cybersol? Right now, th3 current S4 states 250hp, yes?"
48,"April 26, 2002 9:50AM",cybersol,"Yeah, the current S4 has 250 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque. The torque is fully online by 1850 rpm. So this is why it scoots.

The new S4 should be really nice. If you have the time to wait, it might be worth seeing. It might move up in price a little if the performance gets closer to the BMW M3, but then the old S4's should be easier to pick up at a good price right as the new ones are coming out. So many decisions.

Have fun making the right one for you!"
49,"April 27, 2002 2:37PM",1pierce,"Not so fast. There is merit to the ""nationality based"" debate. Let me explain to you why Japanese cars have higher quality (in terms of reliability) than American or European cars. The reason is cultural.

Americans have always had an adventurous, entrepreneurial spirit. We take chances. Its not in our nature to ""accept"" things as they are. I think this is somewhat genetic, since the vast number of us are descended from immigrants - aren't we all, really - people who took tremendous risk, and had great courage to brave the unknown for the promise of a new and better life. As such, in areas of design, we bore very easily. Americans are always looking for the next great thing, the next new design, the next technology breakthrough. Europeans, especially Germans, are like this about cars, if not about everything else. The US auto industry is always ready to chuck the old and start over from scratch - witness Chrysler and Ford over the last two decades. As such, our products are usually stylish and inventive, but not very refined - see minivans, SUV's, cab-forward, night-vision, etc..

The Japanese by comparison have a culture that is traditional and thousands of years old. They have made an entire culture out of honoring tradition and the status quo. We had to yank them kicking and screaming into the 20th century after world war II. I know this is somewhat simplistic, but bear with me. What the Japanese are good at is taking an idea and refining it year after year, until it is near perfect. There is very little innovation or risk taking. That is why the cars are so bland. When was the last time you saw a new technology invented in Japan? VCR's, computer technology, cell phones, the microwave oven...all American inventions that are better built by the Japanese. The same goes for cars. Most innovations come from the US or Germany, with some safety innovations coming from Scandinavia (give up the turbos and 5-cylinders, already those are as refined as they're going to get!).

Anyway,...when you distill it down to its essence, this is why Toyotas and Hondas never break. Its also why they are no more than transportation appliances. And, this is why the best performance cars from Japan will always be knock-offs (albeit sometimes very good ones) of something somebody else does better and more originally.

I'll step off my soap box now, and await your wailing."

52,"December 28, 2013 9:41AM",markcincinnati,"I nearly cracked up when I read your comment, CD, that my wife and I were ""slumming"" with her Infiniti and my Acura. I guess your equating both our return to Audis (or German cars in general) to the ""economy"" is perhaps somewhat (or more than somewhat) true, too.
Yet, to be more transparent, I think it is also acccurate to say that the Japanese cars we had were (quoting my wife: ""passionless"") even though they were worthy of being described as ""premium"" class.
I had so wanted the Q50 to be what its advanced press promised; and, if you'll recall, I custom ordered an IS 350 F Sport in Ultra White with a red leather interior, AWD and a bunch of options. When my wife ordered a Q5 3.0T, I tes drove the S4 and thought it to be ""beyond reach"" even though it was clearly able to outperform the IS in every way (including price.)
The Audi dealer somehow came up with a lease price that made switching my plans and coming ""home"" to Audi a no brainer. So yea, the economy observation does ring true, but not the whole story.
Regarding the length of my posts, well, I once again have something to go on about.
I do urge anyone even thinking about the cars under discussion here to include a test drive of an S4; you may find, as did I, that an S4 is ""within reach.""
Until next time: Drive it like you live!"
53,"December 28, 2013 1:01PM",nyccarguy,The board is definitely livening up a bit again. I like it. Infiniti's strong point in this segment with the Q50 are stunning good looks and gobs of power at a very reasonable price. The 3.7L VQ most definitely will not be as smooth as the German sixes. I would say Infiniti's V6 is smoother than BMW's N20 2.0 Turbo 4.
54,"December 28, 2013 2:53PM",nyccarguy,Interesting - seems Infiniti has gone the way of the Germans & has leatherette seating standard on the Q50. It is an option on the Q50 Premium.
55,"January 7, 2014 9:48AM",graphicguy,"Someone asked for a compare/contrast with the new TL SH AWD and the previous one I had, in addition to a comparison to the S4. I just can't remember which thread asked for the post, so putting it here.
I'll get this out of the way up front so ""markincincinnati"" doesn't raise his blood pressure. The S4 drives better, no question. In some areas, it's significantly better, in other areas just a smidgeon better. Then there are areas where the TL SH AWD is better.
First, the difference between my former 4G TL SHA AWD and this one. The new one is smoother. There's no trans ""shifting"" feeling going on. My old one had the 5 speed auto. The new one, a 6 speed. I think the ratios are closer together which might account for the smoothness. And, I believe the 6th gear has a taller ratio than the old one. One tank of gas in, 50-50 driving, I got 23 MPG. Plenty acceptable. That's about 10% better than the old TL and about the same amount better than the S4.
So, I like the new trans in the TL. It's not as good as the DSG 7 speed in the S4. But, it is better than the one in the previous. Again, smooth with good manual control via the paddle shifters. The S4 will bang gears with the best of them, automatic or manual, no ifs, ands or buts.
The S4 is fast, without a doubt. It's probably the fastest sports sedan I've ever driven, and will rival many muscle cars. The TL is quick. It has plenty of power, especially once you get around the 3K RPM range where the torque kicks in. The S4 has torque all over the range rev. The new 6 speed in the TL makes it feel quicker than the old one. Again, different gear ratios.
Handling-the TL is FWD based, even though it has the torque vectoring tick going on (as did the S4). So, there is a difference between the S4 and the SH AWD of the TL. Not as much as you might expect, though. They're really close in the handling dept. I find myself sometimes saying, ""I liked the S4 better"". At other times I find myself saying (""the TL SH AWD is as good as the S4, and also more forgiving""). Tough to choose one over the other.
Ride-this goes to the new TL. I think Acura has out BMWd BMW with the ride/handling compromise. Acura must have recalibrated the suspension in some way. It's firm without being uncomfortable. Where the S4 sometimes crashes over bumps in the road, the TL absorbs them without drama.
Seat comfort goes to the TL. They were, and continue to be some of the best sports seats in any car I've ever driven. They're snug without pinching (something the S4's seats sometimes do).
Fit and finish is a tie. The old TL, the new TL and the S4 are all exemplary in fit and finish. However, as with the old TL, everything in the new TL just works the way it's supposed to. That's a far cry from what I experienced with the S4. All electronics work. There's no in car internet in the TL, but I let the uber expensive in car internet lapse in the S$ because it was slow, and unneeded. Since I did let it lapse in the S4, some of the NAV maps went bonkers (next to no information about the roads being displayed on the NAV). On the TL, it's straight forward, accurate and detailed.
As good as the B&O stereo was in the S4, the system in the TL (ELS) is better. It's simply one of the best factory sound systems on the market, in any car.
Styling, as always, is subjective. I liked the look of the older TL. I like the look of my new one better. I'm way in the minority here, though. The S4 is classic Audi with the LCD daytime running lights that everyone seems to like these days. I liked the look of the S4, too.
Here's where markincinnati and I will part. I had the check from Audi buying back my S4. I pocketed around $14K and got the new TL SH AWD Advance...as loaded as you can get one.
Is the S4 better? As I started, some ways yes, other ways no. Is it $14K better? Not even close...not even $10K better, and I'd have to try really, really hard to make a case that it's $5K better.
Don't get me wrong. Both are really good cars. If you're looking to blow people's doors off at stop lights, while having a good handling 4 door, the S4 is for you.
If you want something more well rounded, that does a lot of things well, the TL is for you (just don't go seeking any Mustang GTs down at a stop light...wait until you get into the corners)."

58,"January 7, 2014 10:08PM",nyccarguy,"@graphicguy
Great write up. You did an exemplary job at comparing thoroughly & objectively."
59,"January 9, 2014 10:00AM",markcincinnati,"graphicguy - when I first came to the ""economic"" realization, in 2011, that I would feel the prudent choice for my next car (out of a 2009 Audi A4 Prestige) would not be another Audi (a new A4 to replace the '09 would have been about $100+ more per month and the lease term 6 months longer), I tested many brands.
The 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance seemed like a good choice since it most reminded me of an Audi (and specifically it reminded me more of an S4 than an A4 2.0T with sport package.) I had read a 2010 Automobile Magazine comparison report of the S4 and TL which did say most folks would probably never cross shop the two cars, but overall, the TL SH-AWD was favorably reviewed even though it was ""out-gunned"" and out-priced by the S4.
I find myself more in violent agreement with your thoughts than any other perspective. Your recent experience with an S4 certainly has made you come by your observations and opinions honestly. Indeed, your overview was balanced.
The most subjective part of many purchases we make is typically ""value"" -- some folks will value an ""extra 10%"" sufficiently to allow them to cost-justify a 25% (or more in some cases) price difference. This is true in cars, clothes, food and seat choices at sporting events (to name just a few).
The S4's creators, as I noted, seems to ""cost"" fun-to-drive at about $10,000 over the TL SH-AWD Advance. Today, I see the S4 as being worth the premium. In 2011, I could not cost-justify such a price delta.
Bang for the buck does go to the Acura. I am thinking, too, that there are other high bang for the buck offerings available from Korea -- at the same time, I am also thinking the new Cadillac CTS is a lower value proposition than the previous generation CTS. Clearly these preferences are highly subjective.
Objectively (or as objectively as possible), the Acura can be evaluated as having greater content per dollar than the Audi. Although more subjective in nature, I believe it is probable that any collection of ""professional"" reviewer's opinions about the two cars would reveal these reviewers to find the S4 more praise-worthy. Objective (measured) test results, too, would probably show the Audi's performance to be higher than the Acuras -- even if often only slightly thus.
It all comes down to ""how much"" it is worth to you to have one vs the other. No such comparison is possible, given the 5-figure price difference between the two vehicles, but I wonder which car would be ""chosen"" if they were priced virtually identically and identically contented.
I assume if the choice of a new loaded TL SH-AWD or a new loaded S4 were presented, and both had an asking price of $47,500, that the S4 would be chosen more frequently (the vast majority of the time.)
Can't prove this, of course, but it would make for an interesting study of ""perceived value.""
Today, therefore, I'll agree that the TL SH-AWD Advance offers a very high value; but, I will also -- today -- pay the upcharge for the S4 and attribute that price difference to the cost of the ""fun-to-drive"" factor.
DILYL -- with the emphasis on ""you""!"
60,"January 11, 2014 9:44AM",graphicguy,"Mark...as always...appreciate your insight.
At the end of the day, that's the reason there are so many choices, particularly in the ELLPS sliver of the market.
Competition keeps all of these vehicles we discuss smack in the middle of what I consider some of the most desireable cars on the road. They are certainly among the most capable cars you can drive...probably in any of the individual brands' line up.
Long and short of it, there's no wrong answer here.
Since I'm fresh off of test drives, it's clear where some of these manufacturers are going. BMW, for reasons that befuddle me, are softening up their cars. I suspect most will like that. Personally, I don't. But, looks like it's helping them sell more cars. Same can be said for the Infiniti Q, although that softening doesn't seem to be helping them whatsoever in selling the new Q50. Shame.
Benz is going for high style. I saw pics of the new C class, and drove the CLA. I'm guessing the new C will drive similarly to the old C. Nothing compelling there. CLA shows Benz trying to become the style leader while offering run of the mill driving dynamics. Seems to be working for them as they just surpassed BMW as the U.S. luxury car sales leader. Not my cup 'o tea, but they've been successful with that strategy.
Audi keeps marching to their own beat. Good for them for doing it. To me, they are the performance leaders. Owning the S4, and having had A6s for extended periods of time as loaners, I can't fathom another manufacturer doing more to imbue their cars with fun to drive characteristics (reliability needs lots of work, though)
If there's one place Acura has fallen down, it's in the style dept. They've got the engineering down. Their performance is competitive, their operation, build and reliability are rock solid. I don't hold out much hope that the upcoming TL(X) will be substantially different from the RLX is style. I like it, most don't. That said, it does feel good to just have such a capable car do everything well, without worry of hiccups.
Wish I could think of a pithy saying to close with. Can't. So, thanks for the input....will have to suffice."

Since having my 320i now for 3 months, I can say that the smoothness is an issue, but since I have upgraded the ECU to the stage one, the extra power has really transformed the car. The harshness doesn't bother me at all, The 320 still have the feel of a BMW, the only positive that the Q50 has is the VQ engine, but that engine has it's issues too."

Like you graphic, the M235i has caught my eye, for under 50K you can get yourself a car that is really a M2 (full M suspension, and other go fast items) with the turbo 6 with the performance pack standard. And with the huge aftermarket for that turbo six the sky is really the limit. Rick really likes the 320i, so I might be able to talk him into using his car on a trade in for the M235i..."

Glad you (and presumably Rick too) are happy with your 320i. My car is in for service and I got a brand spankin new 2014 328xd. This is the 3rd new body style 3 series I've driven. BMW seems to be trying (operative word here) to inject some of its ""ultimate driving machine"" magic more and more. I actually like the new 3er more and more as a commuter. While the steering is still too vague for my tastes, the ride is comfortable & taut, the 8 speed automatic is well matched to both the 4cyl gasser & 4cyl diesel.
The diesel is a bit harsher than the 4cyl gas 320i & 328i. As expected, mid range torque is fantastic, but the most impressive thing of all is the diesel's fuel economy. A green engine (the car had 9 miles on it when I picked it up) is showing between 39 & 40 mpg average. Literally almost double what I get with my 2011 328xi."

80,"January 15, 2014 8:38AM",markcincinnati,"The new Acura TLX (and the press release comments) give me hope for the brand. I am going to assume the engineers and designers at Acura have banished as much of the ""Honda Effect"" as possible. I see no harm in some power train sharing, for example, but Acura needs to be a brand that stands out as a Brand, not just an upscale Honda.
For years (and I know since I owned examples of both brands), it was quite easy to see the resemblance and lineage of Audi and VW. I assume it was Audi who made the decision to ""go their own way"" not the other way around. The result has been beneficial to both brands.
The new Q50 (recently reviewed -- and not all that favorably -- on MotorWeek) got the style right as far as I am concerned. The 3.7L engine has been made to feel much smoother and the interior is more upscale befitting Infiniti's aspirations. Thus far, however, the reviews of the Q50 have been, well, underwhelming. I suspect the driving dynamics that the experts loved in the G37 will need to return and be improved upon sooner rather than later.
The IS from Lexus -- in IS 350 F Sport trim -- seems to have gotten everything right, not so much however the lesser IS's, especially the 250 which has recently been given mostly ""thumb's down.""
Now, along comes Acura with what appears to be a sparkling, spanky new TL(X). Acura, for the past few years, has been apparently wandering aimlessly (with the exception of the MDX, one of Acura's 'reasons for being') -- are they a Premium car-line or are they drifting further away with each passing year (a halo car, which is looking good, ain't enough to redeem them, yet). This new TLX is, from the web pictures a looker -- and the marketing message is pretty darn strong. Like the Q50 and the IS 350 F Sport, however, the proof will be when the automotive press gets their hands on the thing in several states of trim.
Despite my ""one and done"" Acura TL SH-AWD flirtation and my subsequent return to Audi (with an S4 none the less), I did think the Acura was a decent attempt at creating an ELLPS; I still think the 2012 and newer Acura TL SH-AWD models were Acura's S4, and a high value vehicle, too.
So, here's hoping Acura's glintzy (a made up word) new TLX lives up to our expectations as well as its press release. As Van Morrison said (adapted here to mean ""These are the days to be in the market for a new ELLPS""):
""These are the days, the time is now
There is no past, there's only future
There's only here, there's only now.""

It's still got plenty of hurdles to clear though. I'm picky with interiors. I love Audi in that regard. I certainly prefer Honda/Acura to Toyota/Lexus interiors, but we will see what we get here.
On top of that they will be contending with the upcoming A3 sedan and the CLA. I'm glad to see this new class being competitive!"
85,"January 15, 2014 1:21PM",stickguy,"that spy shot of the TLX did look sharp. Not worried about the interior. They seem to have been doing a good job there.
I am curious to see what they do for powertrain. Since it is replacing the TL and TSX, will they go with a 4/6/hybrid? Turbo something?
Will also be nice if it frees up the ILX for a power boost. Basically use the 2.4l on a mid-level AT model, not just the ""hot rod'. That IMO will make it a much more desirable option since it will be plenty quick. Keep the 2.0l for the base car, and have the 2.4 as the upgrade."
86,"January 15, 2014 1:47PM",markcincinnati,"The SH-AWD version will have the 3.5L V6 and a 9-speed dual clutch transmission, at least I think it said dual clutch (the 9-speed I am sure of).
My 2012 TL had a 3.7L V6 rated at 305 HP -- which, these days is close to being too little (unless there is a big torque number that comes on at relatively low RPM's). I would assume Acura has goosed things appropriately all the way around.
With respect to the interior -- well, most folks did not and do not seem to make favorable comments about the ""button-happy"" interior and steering wheel. Once I got used to things, it never really bothered me, but the 2012 interior was not what I would call ""premium"" -- it seemed like, well, TOO MUCH Honda Accord DNA had seeped into it.
Looking at the Audi interiors often spoils [most] people for others interior treatments. I count myself as one of those so spoiled.
I am, however, confident, that Acura will probably get the interior right this time. But wait -- it is probably going to be very much like the RLX, which has been recently criticized for still being too busy."
87,"January 15, 2014 2:34PM",robr2,New 2.4 at about 200 HP with an 8 speed dual clutch auto with a torque converter and a 9 speed auto. SH-AWD and 4 wheel steering available on the 6.
88,"January 15, 2014 2:52PM",graphicguy,"I believe Acura was pretty early to the 300+ HP V6 party. I know my Mustang GT SOHC V8 had 300 HP less than 10 years ago. BMW is still touting their twin scroll turbo 6 as 300 HP (albeit I suspect that's under rated). The Lexus (x)S 350 V6 is right at that mark, too. The Infiniti V6 in the Q/G sedans have more HP, but are down on torque compared to the Acura V6.
Audi uses a S/C on their 6 cyl, and is a great performer. Their 4 cyl is 220HP but is torquey.
So, I think Acura is dead on if they end up with a 210-230 HP 4 cyl and a 310-320 HP V6. Again, 8 sp DCT or 9 sp transmissions put them right at the front of the class, too.
Mark, I don't think Acura gives up anything to the Audi's interior in materials, build, or functionality. Like you, I've owned both. Still say the ELS sound system in the current TL trumps the B&O system in the S4.
I'm into my new TL for at least 2-3 more years. After that, I'll be in my Acura store first visit of any shopping trip."

About the F80 M3 and F82 M4
The all-new BMW M3 Sedan and first-ever BMW M4 Coupe are examples of the legendary BMW M engineering which emphasizes a synthesis of motorsport technology with unrestricted daily driving versatility. World-class engine and powertrain technologies, along with intelligent lightweight vehicle construction through extensive use of exotic construction materials, add to the intensity of the M feeling and driving experience. The extensive weight-reduction efforts of the BMW M engineers should not be under looked. The new BMW M3 and BMW M4 are the first BMW M cars to see a reduction in curb weight from one generation to the next. Both models are equipped with an all-new 3.0-liter inline-6 engine with M TwinPower Turbo technology and increased performance levels that distinguish them from previous generations of the M3 family, delivering 425 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque. Both the M3 Sedan and M4 Coupe accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 3.9 seconds when equipped with the optional M-DCT transmission. By setting new segment standards in terms of dynamics, agility, precise handling and emotional design, the new BMW M3 Sedan and BMW M4 Coupe have set the benchmark for the high-performance segment created by the M3 many years ago.
For the full run down"
91,"January 15, 2014 8:56PM",graphicguy,FN....thanks for the BMW M update. I'll have to check out their pics from the NAIAS.
92,"January 16, 2014 8:43AM",dash5,"The TL was a car I wanted to like but just couldnt make it happen. This segment is too full of excellent competitors to misfire on any one thing too badly. The TL just fell a bit short in both interior and exterior for me. Felt too much like a slightly better Accord for a lot more money.
Ironically I ended up with a Kia So I'm not necessarily into the badge thing, more the value. I didnt feel like the Acura sedans were enough of a value.
This new TLX though is high on my watch list. Right there with the A3/S3."
93,"January 16, 2014 10:28AM",graphicguy,"FN.....I just totally read your link to the M cars. Interestingly, the twin turbo straight 6 is still being used. I thought them giving up on V8s for M Power, and having what appeared to be the more recent ""twin sroll"" turbo charger, they would ""tweak"" the latter given how it's a more recent engine than the twin turbocharger unit.
But, they are getting great performance out of it. As they say, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
Still can't wait to see the 235i M car."

Also the weight difference between the M235i and M3/4 cars is significant, being that the M3/4 cars weight less.... I' with you graphic, the new M235i will be the car to get, back to the basic's and for about $44K."

I really doubt the amount of discount has anything to do with country of assembly for majority of deals. I suppose once in a while there may a customer who will complain and may receive a ""consolation"" discount, but I don't think those are statistically significant events."
118,"January 20, 2014 10:02AM",stickguy,My guess is a fair number of BMW buyers don't know which wheels drive the car and very few have a clue about where they are built.

I don't know if any of those things are made in China right now (except iPad), but I bet they either used to before going to even cheaper place (like Vietnam or Bangladesh), or their close competitors are currently made in China.
BTW, I may be wrong, but I don't think BMW currently makes its cars in China - they make some specifically FOR Chinese market. They probably source some components (who doesn't?), I'm sure, but not so regarding cars themselves."
123,"January 20, 2014 3:04PM",Mr_Shiftright,"I would as long as BMW is in charge of building it, training the workers, setting up the work environment, and sourcing the critical parts."
124,"January 20, 2014 4:33PM",tifighter,"@dino001 I understand that most things are made in China. My question is would YOU buy a BMW made in China?
I posted an article above in which the head of Volvo says that Chinese-made Volvos will be exported to the US market soon. I think this, rightly or wrongly, could be an issue for Volvo and euro-brand buyers. Since the subsequent posts spoke of where BMW's were made, I modified it a bit to get a sense of reaction.
But the fact remains that Chinese-made Euro-branded cars are coming soon to the US. My question remains for everyone. BMW seems a favorite brand here; if the cars available at your dealer were Chinese-made, would you buy one?"
125,"January 20, 2014 6:04PM",roadburner,I'd wait a while and let a few other buyers serve as beta testers...
126,"January 20, 2014 7:21PM",nyccarguy,"@MrShift@Edmunds and @roadburner
I agree with you. The cars won't be Chinese designed BMWs. All of the crucial parts will still be designed & manufactured elsewhere. BMW isnt going to allow cheap Chinese manufactured steel to be used in its chassis or cheap chinese aluminum to fabricate its engine blocks. The factories are becoming more and more automated. Maybe it will make the cars more affordable."
127,"January 20, 2014 7:32PM",dino001,"My point was that if we accept other items made in China by upscale branded manufacturers, it is easy to imagine cars, too. The key is production control. If Sony, Nike, or others can do it, so could BMW, if they so desired. And yes, I would buy one, if I there was a good data supporting it was same quality."

I kind of wish I hadn't been in such a hurry to get my departed S4. I really wanted to at least test the M235i. I think it looks loads better than the 1, at least in pictures."

My 1995 318ti has one- as does my Mazdaspeed 3 and the latest GTI. I guess I should be happy that RFTs have been ditched in favor of Pilot Super Sports"
135,"January 21, 2014 8:22AM",dino001,"Why? I am a manual trasmission guy, my current and last three cars have had manual transmission, but diesel engine is probably LEAST fun and LEAST suitable with manual trasmission for a passenger car (it's a little different for towing vehicles and tractor trailers with 10-12 gear manuals used to crawl uphill or just maximize efficiency).
This holiday I drove again (just like last year) my dad's Audi A4 with 1.9 TDI and manual transmission (it has sports suspension, too) and it was not a fun car, not to me anyway. The reason? Simple - diesel powerband is so narrow and short that I had to constantly shift up and down even on straight roads (just slight speed variation made it uncomfortable, if the car was on wrong gear). Ramp merging was a bit less scary than last year (as I got used to it and learned a little), but nevertheless couldn't hold a candle to a nice gasoline engine of similar power (even lower torque), when you can keep your car on same gear up to 5K+ rpm and keep accelerating. Diesel nicely kicks the speed up, but then equally suddenly dies in the middle of the manouver making you shift at least comfortable moment and lose time/distance.
If there is one type of passenger car that I don't mind well spaced and timed multigear automatic (or CVT), it is exactly small diesel. I think people's wish to have MT diesel is simply misguided, based on what is not available and never tried. It almost feels like ""because these evil people don't offer it, it must be good""."
136,"January 21, 2014 9:20AM",Mr_Shiftright,I'd agree with that...a turbo diesel is more compatible with a good automatic in a passenger car.
137,"January 21, 2014 9:26AM",flightnurse,"Exactly, the 8 spd in the BMW is one of the best in the business, and it suited for the diesel perfectly. What I have noticed, most of the 328d's on lots in Phoenix, have the sport package as well as M sport package, this give the transmission the Sport + feature. quicker shifting, holds gears longer, quicker throttle, add paddle shifting option and it's one of the best combo's."
138,"January 21, 2014 9:27AM",flightnurse,"I guess I should have stated in my posting of the video that even though the M135 is a 135, it gives you an idea on what the M235i will be able to do."
139,"January 21, 2014 11:53AM",nyccarguy,"@dino001
I agree with you. I recently had a 328xd loaner car while mine was in for service (they finally fixed the trunk latch). The 8 speed automatic is perfectly matched to the Diesel turbo 4."
140,"January 21, 2014 7:14PM",cdnpinhead,"Well, I guess you told me.
I've driven seven different diesels with manual transmissions (not counting my '71 KW with the RT910 Roadranger) in Europe between 2001 and 2013. I enjoyed each one and generally try to avoid complication in my vehicles. Manual transmissions rarely fail and cost significantly less to repair, plus which I can shift when and how I want, including skipping gears or changing my mind in the middle as traffic conditions change. That said, it's clear that BMW knows what it's doing, since there appears to be universal acceptance of what they're peddling."
141,"January 21, 2014 9:16PM",flightnurse,"Can't compare what happens in Europe with here, in Europe more cars are sold with manual transmissions than here in the states, have to sell what people want."
142,"January 22, 2014 8:31AM",dino001,"Well, I guess, our priorities are simply different. I'm sure it probably lies in one's definition of ""fun"" and what each of us considers a good experience. My point of reference for MT experience are good gasoline engines with long powerbands and decent torque (WRX, STI, 328), to which diesel simply cannot hold a candle in terms of driving satisfaction. I talked to many owners of diesels in Europe and ""fun"" is not even in their vocabulary. Their reasons of getting diesel is plain and simple - money.
I consider current 328d a first BMW's legitimate entry in terms of economizing fuel efficiency, Such consideration was not as important in the past, but I guess times change, more and more marginal customers buy those things, so lowering their cost of ownership is one way of expanding the market opportunity. I think the 8AT is just right for it. I don't think 6MT would be any better in terms of driving experience and it would not provide any fuel economy savings. It might provide potential for better durability, but I didn't hear of massive failures of those BMW's autos. I may be misinformed, of course.
The background of European popularity of diesel does not lie in its inherent ""fun"", or otherwise superior performance. It is a plain fuel economy advantage traded for clunky sound, higher noise, lower powerband. The diesel engines went long way from times when they were very slow and had unbearable vibrations. Today's turbos fixed that off-line acceleration problem - in fact the punch provided by diesel is better than gasoline - the only thing is it doesn't last. The maintenance seems to be more of an issue today, that's the price paid for better engine. The engines reportedly do not last as long as they used to, they are more sensitive to fuel quality, which can be a problem in certain areas and repair costs are massive. To be fair, that's true about all cars, not just diesels.
In the world of $8-10/galon fuel (today's prices in Euro zone), every drop counts, so getting your car going further has real financial consequences, even for more affluent people. Only richest of the rich don't have to factor that in, the rest needs to consider if the great gasoline V6/I6, so popular with many Americans (not to mention V8), is affordable. Memo: it is not. Thus, the second and real only choice becomes a decent diesel. Prior recent boom, diesel fuel was also considered a lower grade byproduct and it was taxed less, creating a double bang for a buck (higher mpg on lower priced fuel). That advantage is gone now and one can already see the trend not as strong as it used to be."
143,"January 22, 2014 8:40AM",markcincinnati,"Regarding Diesels & Transmissions post (above):
I suppose there is some chance that the manual transmission ""option"" will soldier on, probably for several more years. However, the manual transmission is, sadly, on its death-bed. Sadly? Sure, sadly -- because manual transmission cars (or more accurately said ""some"" manual transmission equipped cars) generally speaking are more fun to drive; and, until recently manual transmission cars provided real, measurable benefits simply unavailable with even the best transmissions that shift(ed) themselves.
Today, however, the manual transmission crowd, of which I consider myself to be a member, really doesn't have any attribute (that can be measured) that makes it ""better"" than some automatics. And, the thing is, even those automatics which are inferior -- today -- to a stick-shift, will likely soon be replaced with incrementally better autos until virtually all the automatic transmissions on the market are equal to or better than manuals.
Then, as a natural progression, all automatics offered will render manuals measurably inferior -- leaving only ""fun-to-drive"" as their reasons for being. Of course, in the ELLPS and LPS world, at least, manuals will simply no longer be offered as the upcoming crop of drivers is both unfamiliar with manuals (read: unable to drive them) and really confused as to why anyone would even want to shift a car.
We are progressively moving toward the autonomous automobile -- at least if you believe the story on CBS's Sunday Morning program where the new autonomous technologies were put on display courtesy of Mercedes (and Volvo and, and, and).
Manual transmissions, like light beers, are dead and they just don't know it yet.
I used to jump in a cab in Munich (often a light yellow Mercedes) and most of the time it was a manual transmission diesel version of the MB E Class. These days -- well since 2005 -- most of the cabs are as noted but with automatic transmissions. My assumption is, this can be seen as a bellwether -- either a predictor or cause-agent of things that will ""soon"" be adopted universally.
My 1995 Audi S6 was ONLY available with a manual transmission; I can't even imagine a 2014 S6 so equipped -- and, frankly, despite my ""fun-to-drive"" comments, I can't even imagine I would want a 2014 S6 with a manual trans.
How many of the ELLPS and LPS cars on the market are even offered with an ""optional"" manual transmission? Or perhaps the more pertinent question is what is the % of manual transmission versions of these ELLPS and LPS cars that are sold (at least in the US, anyway)? I would be pleasantly shocked to hear almost any number greater than 2%. The economics of offering an auto and a manual version are, likewise, already in play -- if a German manufacturer has to certify both a manual and an auto version of a model to be able to sell them in the US (and elsewhere, I'd imagine), my guess is they will simply decide there is no economic justification for certifying a model that represents but a tiny portion of sales, no matter what we say here, or no matter what the editors and writers of Car & Driver, et al, [non-permissible content removed] about.
I'm so happy with my S4's 7-Speed S-Tronic (""automatic manual""), I really don't even miss the stick shift. I did, however, test drive the 2014 S4 with a manual, and I must say it sure was ""fun-to-drive"". I'm over it now, however. To the S-Tronic I say: ""You're a better man than I am, Gunga Din!”
Drive it like you live."
144,"January 22, 2014 9:33AM",dino001,"I agree. I already made peace with my next car being most likely AT. I had a good run - three manuals in the row, ordered and driving probably last 328 wagon with MT they produced for US market (if not last, it is likely to be one of ten last). It should have some number etched into it. It will take a real enthusiast to take it off my hands at a good price when its time comes. More likely I will have to accept a lowball offer from a dealer."
145,"January 23, 2014 9:18AM",graphicguy,"Dino....like you and Mike, I've also made my peace over my past obsession with manual transmissions. I can't say as I could better the performance of these new(er) autmatic transmissions.
Probably the only exception would be a manual trans in a muscle car or a Miata.
That said, that market is so small in this country, and the demand is so weak, it is must a matter of time before the manual transmission goes the way of crank windows and non-airconditioned cars."
146,"January 23, 2014 11:47AM",flightnurse,"It appears that BMW will be offering manual transmissions in the 2,3 and 4 series all M cars. There is also rumors that there will be a 2 series sedan too. So for those of you who must have a manual, BMW listened..."
147,"January 23, 2014 12:12PM",robr2,I presume the sedan will be more of a Gran Coupe....
148,"January 23, 2014 7:18PM",markcincinnati,"Wondering what the uptake will be on these new manual trans versions of the 2,3 and 4 series.
Indeed BMW may have listened, but I have to believe that the number of folks who will actually go ahead and buy one of these versions will be tiny, tiny, tiny.
I can't understand why a company would do this based on what I have to assume is a huge check that has to be written to get a car certified for sale in the US.
But, I applaud the effort!
Still lovin' the S-Tronic, I say: Drive it like YOU live."
149,"January 23, 2014 11:25PM",flightnurse,"Ok I really hate this new format sometime it quotes correctly and sometimes it does not..
From the postings on Bimmerfest, both will be offered, but only time will tell."
150,"January 23, 2014 11:29PM",flightnurse,"Since the engine and transmissions in the 2-3,4 series are the same the added cost wouldn't be all that much.
Now will dealers have many manual transmission cars sitting on their lots, I doubt it. Most of the hard core Bimmer fans will do the ED program so this means they will order their cars, so the manual cars will most likely come from these people, which is a small amount in regards to the total sales of BMWs."
151,"January 24, 2014 7:17AM",markcincinnati,"European delivery uptake: That's another data point I'd like to have available. I've ""researched"" Audi's, BMW's, MB's and Volvo's ED programs (BTW, Volvo has a great DVD about their program -- but, well, as has been said, ""Who's Volvo?"")
Pity that Volvo has become almost invisible and for some irrelevant; yet I always find these ED programs ""exciting"" and tell myself, ""Self, we should pick up our next car in Germany and drive it on the Autobahn"". But then it seems so easy to just rent a fill-in-the-blank for a few days, drive the rental on the Autobahn and not worry about parking YOUR new baby in a woefully small German, Italian or French or basement garage only to return to door dings.
So, I end up renting or riding the train from Munich to Verona and enjoying the dining and drinking once you hit the Passo del Brennero (Brenner Pass, i.e.) and the Italian chef comes on board.
Anyway, anyone know the numbers of us 'mericans who actually avail themselves of the various European Delivery programs?
BTW, these programs -- especially Volvo's -- seem like a fairly good deal.

152,"January 24, 2014 7:20AM",graphicguy,"Hearing some scuttlebut about the new 4 cyl in the upcoming Acura TLX. ~280HP with 270 torque at 1,500 rpm. That will be combined with a DCT trans (8-speed). It also includes Acura's 4 wheel steering (P-AWS) That sounds to be a good performer.
If you follow the trend, the SH AWD version will have a 9 speed trans and a 3.5L V6. Guessing that it will put out something in the 310-325 HP range.

Also with the Ed program for the other cars, you have an option of having the car delivered in Spartenburg, and go through the performance center with your car.

My Audi dealer says that based on current inventory, it is now typical for the new cars (without owners names attached already) to be held ""in port"" whilst the current inventory is worked down.
I guess we should appreciate that approach (if we are already owners) since it would seem to help preserve, somewhat, the value of the current model.
I remember when I could go into a dealership and there would be plenty of leftover ""last year models"" gathering dust until the deep discounting started them moving again. Don't see that so much anymore.

I'll lease something like an Accord or Subaru Impreza 5 door and share it with my wife for 15K per year (when she drives the new car, I'll drive her Pilot or my Prelude when the weather is nice).

Well, the truth of the matter is that BMW [among others] does provide ""financial support"" for leases made through their financial companies. This support is often (usually) called a ""sub-vented lease.""
Subventing makes leasing more attractive to the buyer who doesn't care so much about the MSRP of a given vehicle, but does care about the monthly payment. Either a purchase or a lease ""deal"" can be subvented -- but the real impact of subventing is going to be able to be much greater for a lease than a loan.
The best thing that can be done regarding a loan to buy a new car is that the interest rate charged can be set to zero (0% apr). This way a $36,000 car can be purchased and the payments determined by dividing $36,000 by the number of months that payments will be made. $36,000 divided by 36 months, then, equals DOH! a $1,000 per month payment.
I assume we could stretch the point and say that the manufacturer could offer a ""loyalty"" or ""conquest"" or even a ""just because"" bonus or rebate or discount of $1,000, making the amount financed be only $35,000, meaning the payment would be $35,000 divided by 36 months or $972.22/month.
A subvented lease, on the other hand, is where the mfg can really influence your ""purchase"" decision. Here's why.
When you lease a new car, the payment will be determined (generally speaking) by several things:
1.The % of value (residual value) that the car will have at the end of the lease
2.The money factor (think of it as the interest rate) that is used.
Roughly speaking you can calculate the lease payment (remember the word ""roughly"") by subtracting the residual value from the MSRP of the car to get your anticipated usage cost.
If the car is $36,000 and its residual is 50%, your usage over 36 months is $18,000. If you put money (out of your pocket) as what you might term a ""down payment"" you will reduce the amount of the ""agreement"" by that amount (this is called a capitalized cost reduction).
This ""down payment"" [in your mind] does not reduce the residual value of the car, meaning that if you decided to buy the car at the end of the lease the amount you will have to come up with will still be $18,000. Please, don't call any money down on a conventional (closed-end) lease a down payment and I won't either. It is a ""cap cost reduction"" -- and the purpose of this cap cost reduction is solely to reduce the monthly payment. You are NOT building up any value, post lease, whatsoever.
The money factor (or the implied cost of money -- or interest rate) is applied to recognize the value of the ""time"" you have the auto mfg's finance arm's money tied up.
Far more detailed explanations -- and explanations that are specific to your lease deal -- are available here on Edmunds and of course at your dealership.
The bottom line, however, is this: the auto manufacturer's financial outlet may offer a lease to you that has been subvented by the manufacturer. The subventing can take the form of:
A reduction of the money factor -- including taking it to zero; or,
An increase of the residual % -- including taking it to a very optimistic % (+5% or even more) -- meaning the car will be said to be worth a much larger percentage of its brand new value than market conditions would likely support.
This manipulation of the residual cannot be done when the car is financed outright -- so perhaps you can see that a subvented lease could produce a very very low monthly payment if the mfg decides to reduce the money factor to zero or near zero and increases the residual value significantly over the expected depreciation.
Subvented leases often carry with them terms that are not as ""friendly"" to you as a straight buy with a loan or a lease that has not been subvented.
If the manufacturer says the residual is 62% after 36 months and the reality of the situation is that the 36 month value should only be 55%, you may not be able to get out of your lease early without a huge $ penalty (plus perhaps a standalone early termination fee or penalty).
If you buy and finance a car, you can sell or trade you car almost at any time and only pay the potential difference between the outstanding loan amount and the amount you can sell the car for. It may feel like a prepayment penalty, but the reality is that there will be no literal prepayment penalty (it is uncommon for an auto loan from a bank, for instance, to have a prepayment penalty -- if you want to get out of the loan, you can sell the car and give the proceeds to the bank plus a bit more out of your pocket or perhaps a check from the bank.)
So, leases give, leases take. Leases are sometimes of the very, very low payment variety -- meaning there is some subventing going on and suggesting that you'd better be prepared to not fall out of love with your new baby for ""about 90%"" of the lease's term. I say that because it is also common practice to put customers in 39 month leases and then around month 33 start to seduce ""owners"" into the showrooms with the promise of letting them out of their leases without penalties if they re-lease the new model.
BMW does have a reputation -- I assume well founded -- for ""supporting"" (subventing) leases. This can make getting into a $50,000 Bimmer ""within reach."" It also pretty much locks customers into the cycle of ""lease, burn through the lease, and re-lease"" again and again.
Nothing wrong with that for a lot of consumers. But not for all.
If you want to keep your car 5 years or longer, you may not find leasing economics works for you;
If you drive more than 18,000 miles per year (and probably the message could be ""more than 15,000 miles per year), you may not find leasing economics works for you (as your residual will likely drop sharply, meaning the monthly payment will rise sharply in response);
If you own a business, on the other hand, leasing may mean you can ""expense your lease payment"" to the company (with proper and available proof), which many would consider to be a good thing;
If you want to build equity in your car, well that is ""highly"" (or at least ""fairly"") unlikely in a leased car, but more likely in a car that you are making payments on to buy.
And the pros of leasing AND buying go on.
Neither my wife nor I had ever purchased a car, until late 2013 when we bought her '14 Audi SQ5 Prestige; we also lease a '14 Audi S4 (and are fully intending, 4 months into the lease, to buy the thing at the end of the lease -- and we put NO money down on the lease). This is a new experience for us and we keep rationalizing that -- at this time -- buying (for us) will likely turn out to be a better deal since we intend on keeping the cars more than 5 years.
So, my point in all that is above is this: Auto manufacturers DO indeed provide financial subsidies (i.e., named subvented lease programs). Multiple security deposits are NOT, strictly speaking, subsidies, however.

190,"January 29, 2014 1:21PM",robr2,Don't forgot the MSD's are on top of the capital cost reduction. They can't get the $300 a month deal without the $2995 and they couldn't afford the $410 or so monthly lease without the CCR.
191,"January 29, 2014 3:32PM",markcincinnati,"I would NOT put any cap cost reduction money into this; I would, however, consider MSD's since you do get it back at the end of the lease -- cap cost reduction money is gone forever and even worse if the lease has no GAP coverage to account for the delta between value and owed (the gap between, so to speak) should the leased vehicle be totaled.
If you can or want to put money down on the lease and it gets you where you want to be, I have no issue with it. However, if you've got that money, I would assume you also can justify lighting your cigars with paper money instead of matches (wooden, of course).
Seriously, money to lower a lease payment is somewhat hard to justify these days. If $2,995 lowers the mo pay by $100 for 36 months, wouldn't it be acceptable to put the money in an account and know that at least you've got 30 of the next 36 payments (the $100 difference, that is) accounted for?
Let's not assume we know how better to spend someone else's money.
I've learned a lot from Edmunds and Audi World, etc; I used to think putting something toward the lease was at least OK. Now I think differently -- but that is certainly in part due to the participation of many folks here. I found my stupidity is incurable, I found my ignorance could be cured, however.

@markincincinnati brought up a great point about GAP insurance. It's automatically written into every auto leasing and financing contract in New York State. So there's another ""if"" that could have potentially cost me more money by leasing from a dealer here in Connecticut. Depending on the dealer, they charge $400 - $700 for this optional protection.

So right there you are talking $2250, this will cover fee's and first month payment, and a slight cap reduction (remember all this is ZERO out of pocket.) then add 7 MSDs, so basically you could just walk into the dealer, with $3500 and walk out with a payment of $540/m on that 50K car, and at the end of your lease get that $3500 back. Those 7 MSD's well save you roughly $50/m x 36 = $1800. So you could walk into and have a cap reduction that doesn't cost you a cent but helps to lower the payments slightly.

205,"February 10, 2014 7:30AM",dash5,"We should see the Jaguar entry into this class pretty soon:
http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1054587_jaguar-small-sedan-to-be-revealed-this-summer-report
Jaguar’s new small sedan to take on the likes of the BMW 3-Series and Mercedes-Benz C-Class will go on sale in 2015 and be the first model spawned from an advanced aluminum structure known as the iQ[Al]. However, we won’t have to wait too long to see the car revealed, according to the latest reports.
Just-Auto, based on an interview with Jaguar design boss Ian Callum, is reporting that the new car, rumored to be called the XS, will be revealed as early as this summer. This suggests that we could see it, or at least a concept version, unveiled at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in late June, the Brit event where last year Jaguar presented its Project 7 concept car.
During the same interview, Callum is also reported to have said that Jaguar is planning facelifts for several models, including the recently launched F-Type range. Though he didn’t confirm plans for any other models, we know due to test mule sightings that Jaguar is also working on a new crossover as well as a next-generation XF.
As for the XS, it is based on the aforementioned iQ[Al] structure, a lightweight aluminum design that will incorporate a new family of four-cylinder engines called the Hotfire series. Jaguar has also designed its iQ[Al] structure to be able to accommodate its 3.0-liter V-6 already offered in the F-Type range."

I could of bought if I wanted to, even a 5 series...but, I live in Hawaii, I don't want to think about the long term maintenance, the effect of the salt & sun and I like driving a new car. So, the next BMW, in about 2 years will be ED and I am already looking forward to that experience. As far as gaining equity, I'm just not interested, I have better things to spend my money on."
207,"February 12, 2014 8:31PM",sweendogy,"I'm happy to see flight still test driving cars with no intention of purchase (catty cts)- others are going to auto shows - and others replacing ugly cars (yes TL lovers) to something more sexy. After having an Infiniti g for 39400 miles I recently (2 days ago) swapped for a 13 slightly used and nicely discounted audi s4. Will report back on how its behaving- very impressed by both acceleration, and technology in the new rig. Also its very quiet in comfort mode vs the Japanese version. I will say this about my old G - no problems - a great car for the money and very nice highway cruiser. The audi while very nice has a lot to live up to given its inflated price- will report back as the miles pile up.

I hope I don't see the German dragons because like I mentioned earlier the g had no issues.
4 days old to me- its a tight sedan- sure the s4 trim is nice - the technology and dash layout very tight- the buttons near the shifter and toggle buttons all over the steering wheel and stalks are way over the top and take away from driving. I wanted one with the rear sports diff and waited to get this one- haven't noticed it yet- but others have posted its a must.

214,"February 14, 2014 12:30PM",markcincinnati,"My second new S4 came in late last month -- and I'm loving it! OK, OK, not literally another actual car, rather the Audi break-in part one (~5,000 miles) and a check up and oil change at the dealer.
This 2014 Audi S4 is like every other Audi I've had since 1977 -- you end up getting a new car (on the day you pick it up) and then you get another ""new car"" at 5,000 and around 10,000 miles as the engine seems to really get stronger and stronger.
We've had the worst winter here in SW Ohio in what seems like decades (some local weather types have said this has been one of our worst in over 20 years) and I felt no need to swap tires. The all-seasons that the car came with had zero problems.
My wife's SQ5 (purchased about 6 weeks or so after my S4) has 20"" Continental Extreme DWS all seasons (UHP too) and she's has no traction issues either. I watch the man screaming QUATTRO!!!! on the commercial told from the POV of a tow-truck driver and we are living proof of the prowess of the quattro AWD system.
Sweendogy, I suspect there isn't too much different between your 2013 S4 and my '14, other than the fact that you were able to pay less -- I hope your car is under warranty and is CPO'd, which should at least provide you with the peace of mind (financially) you want. I'll bet any repairs on an S4 out of warranty will be breathtakingly expensive (shudder.)
I finally saw my first SQ5 (other than my wife's) a couple of days ago -- and, finally, finally, saw my first Q50 at long last. Boy, the sales on that one must be slow; I've seen several Lexus IS's though, making me think that one has been a heckuva lot more successful in the market.
The new TLX (show car) actually seems pretty attractive -- although I don't really miss my '12 TL, I don't have any real complaints about it now that it's gone -- the S4 is a totally different experience, but, to my dying day, I do think Acura's TL SH-AWD was their version of an S4 (for a lot less $).
I sat in an S6 at the dealer recently -- now that may be my new Batmobile -- but, hey, for $80,000+ it ought to be.
Anyone have the sales figures for 2013 and so far in 2014 for our list of ELLPS cars?
I'd love to see how the IS, Q50, TL, A4/S4, etc did and are selling.
Drive it like you live."
215,"February 15, 2014 9:10AM",sweendogy,"Mark - from my understanding the 14 s4 came with standard smart key access and maybe on other item items - on reliability I know audi has gotten way better, but as of right now I have plenty of warrantee ahead."
216,"February 18, 2014 8:56AM",markcincinnati,"The ONLY Audi I had that really, truly SCARED me, with respect to reliability, durability and co$t to keep post-warranty, was my 1997 A8. The thing, in warranty thankfully, kept having failure after failure of ""little and medium"" components. I didn't have engine or transmission problems, but I suspect things like the motors (and it had a bunch of them) that controlled the seats, seat belt height and on and on, just kept failing (and being replaced again and again.)
My subsequent Audi was a 2000 A6 4.2, which had brake rotor issues -- but nothing else other than routine mntce to speak of; same thing with my 2001 A6 4.2, brake rotors and everything else was solid.
Since then, my 2003 allroad, 2005 A6 3.2, 2009 A4 2.0T and my current 2014 S4 all seemed to me (pretty early on the S4 though) to be reliable. My 2005 A6, which I kept to about 66,000 miles as I recall, also would make me say ""durable."" Yet, these days with several of the Japanese maker's cars easily going 150,000 miles with ""routine"" mntce, 66K miles hardly is proof positive.
One of the people I work with has a 2005 BMW 5 series and he did buy the extended SERVICE package when he purchased the car new. This was NOT a warranty -- just an extended ""factory"" mntce policy. After 50K miles, these German cars often require wholesale replacement of ""stuff"" in the name of service (maintenance, i.e.)
Audi, too, offers extended mntce (for a price) and there is some procedure you can go through to get your own car CPO'd (again, for a price) which takes the warranty to 100,000 miles (up to 6 years from first date of use). After 100K miles, however, you're on your own.
Here is the thing my friend has found with his BMW -- with his extended service contract in hand, he was able to have a fully paid off car with no added service charges for about 2 years. Then, after the service contract died, he did have some on-going (fairly expensive) service or repairs (it is hard to know, sometimes what is ""broken"" and what is just ""time to replace""), but the cost of the repairs at MAX was $1,400 and typically was $100-$300 -- and didn't actually happen frequently. So, the cost of having a very well maintained, comfortable, good performing 2005 5 series was, at most, $2,000 in one year, typically half that.
When I get in his 2005 BMW, I can tell it isn't as up to date (with respect to the electronics for instance) as a 2014 Audi S4, but overall it is still clearly a very nice performance/luxury car that when detailed looks in near showroom condition and is cheap to own.
I'm looking forward to the latter -- even though I do love to keep up with all the new-tech.
I'm driving my wife's 2014 SQ5 Prestige today -- wow, in some respects I like it better than my S4! Of course the S4 has the S-tronic transmission which has to be driven to be believed.

217,"February 18, 2014 2:52PM",andys120,"I'd be afraid of any of those top-of the line Eurocars out of warranty too. The complex systems always turn up on the A8s, 7ers and S-Classes before they migrate to lesser models. Apparently by the time they go downscale they're pretty much de-bugged. I'm on my third out-of-warranty German car including a 5 Series that now has 150K on it and has only had one expensive failure (Vanos Control Module- $1200). I could be wrong about all this but I've been driving nice cars for the cost of run-of-the mill ones for a decade and a half.."

For some reason I like the X3 more than the 328i, which is atypical since my other favorites are my '02 and Club Sport..."

223,"February 18, 2014 10:02PM",roadburner,"@nyccarguy: The car was throwing a CEL every so often. No driveability issues. There's a TSB for the issue and it calls for an oil change so I got that for ""free."" While it was in the CBS said the car also needed new plugs(plugs used to be a 100K service item- oh well...) AND-as recent slow cranking suggested-the battery was shot. With the IBS you are pretty much locked in to a BMW battery so I bit the bullet and had the dealer do it. At least I should be good for at least another five years/57K on both the new plugs and battery. Driving away the DCT fault light came on. Turns out the steering angle sensor didn't initialize after the battery swap. Ten minutes later my tech beat it into submission and we had no issues after that.
If you haven't guessed, this incident-along with BMW's rush to convert most every vehicle in their lineup into a soulless Germanic Lexus-is what has caused me to seriously consider finding another 1988 M6 to share the garage with the Club Sport. Grab a used Abarth/GTI/MCS JCW for a commuter sled/winter beater and I'm all set."

225,"February 19, 2014 12:40AM",andys120,"Roadburner you're exactly right, this isn't the BMW for lovers of RWD but we have plenty of terrific cars available to us that do feature RWD. We also need to understand that BMW is a wsorldwide maker/seller of cars that happens to be based in Europe. In the European market 5-door ""family sized"" hatches are as common as pickups are in North America.
The Active Tourer will be sold in the USA and I'd bet most will be AWD versions, in fact I might consider one of those.
There's also a lot of moaning among the hard core Propellerheads that BMW shouldn't be making a ""minivan"" but with a 105"" wheelbase the Active Tourer is considerably shorter than the smallest Minivan on the US market, the Mazda 5 (@108""). In fact it has a shorter wb than my E46 Cabrio (107""). By US standards this is a subcompact hatchback."
226,"February 19, 2014 5:17AM",robr2,It's being marketed now as a 2 series. Yeah I don't get why they've chosen to add a FWD MPV to the 2 series line.

The picture is the new Active Tourer and it sells very well in other markets, over on Bimmerfest, like any other BMW forum there are two camps, one that love it and other is they hate it.

GT is a peoplemover, large legroom, softer suspension, standard AWD, etc. - it was made for all those who want sporty BRAND, but [non-permissible content removed] about the rear seat, or ""horrible hard suspension"" in a sporty CAR. GC is more driver's car with SOME room for other people and improved cargo space, available as RWD. It is for people who know exactly what a ""sporty coupe"" really means (I said ""sporty"", not ""sports""), but just want incremental (read limited) improvement in people and cargo moving abilities vs. traditional coupe.

When the previous generation 7 series was introduced in 2002, I actually interviewed for a position at the BMW dealer in Manattan to become an ""iDrive Delivery Specialist."" I didn't get the job because I questioned the way I'd be paid. It was to be a $200 per week base and then I'd get paid more based on a CSI score. I asked how my pay would be affected if someone's iDrive crashed before try got their survey. That was a chance I couldn't take living in Manhattan trying to support myself.

My Dad had an '07 X5 which was the 1st car BMW introduced with the ""beer tap shifter."" One morning in a snow storm, he drove over a 2 x 4 (that he couldn't see). The ""low coolant"" light went on, so he pulled over, shut the truck off, and looked to see if there was any coolant spewing out from underneath it. He lifted the hood and everything looked OK. He fired the X5 back up and was about to head to the dealer, when he looked down at the dash and the low coolant light wasn't on anymore. So he continued on his way to work.
Now I have to tell you that my Dad travels back and forth to work with his 2 Great Danes. He keeps a piece of plywood over the folded rear seats to keep his truck cleaner.
Anyway, its snowing, it's 6:30 AM, and my Dad's X5 literally shuts off in the middle of the Tappan Zee Bridge. I'm cleaning off my Prelude getting ready to go to work and I see he keeps calling me. Maybe he plans to tell me about an accident on the way (we work together)? I listen to the voice mail, he says: ""call me, I'm stuck on the bridge.""
I call him back and he tells me the story, then asks: ""how do I get this thing into neutral so the thruway authority can load it on the flatbed?"" He checks the owner's manual. Without the owner's manual we sold have never figured out:
Remove the cup holder, remove the piece under the cup holder, remove red ""T"" key from the spare tire compartment. Stick the red ""T"" key into the square hole underneath the cup holders and twist to release the transmission so vehicle can be loaded on to flatbed.
Just a few problems, he had to get out of the car in the snow on a bridge (cars flying by on the driver's side & the Hudson River on the passenger side). Open the rear lift gate to get to the ""T"" key where the spare tire is seems easy enough, except it was under a piece of plywood perfectly cut to fit the rear of the X5. The tow truck drivers from the NYS Thruway Authority can't help him because every time they try to help my Dad pick up the plywood, his 140 lb Great Danes start barking and scare the pants off the poor guys."
273,"February 21, 2014 10:58PM",roadburner,"@nyccarguy: Another reason to despise the beer tap. To me it feels flimsy and is non-intuitive. It is a classic example of BMW hell-bent on fixing something that wasn't broken- ""Ja, ve vill be different because ve can, you stupid Amerikaners..."""

Meanwhile, the driving experience that built BMW's modern legacy continues to devolve into mediocrity."
277,"February 22, 2014 8:36PM",dino001,"Beer tap shifter allowed them to release some space in center console for storage and decent cupholder. Regular shifter has larger range of movement and blocks more space. That's the story I heard from a salesman, anyway."

That is just ridiculous. Aside from the space saving justification given earlier no one has been able to explain how the beer tap is superior to a conventional automatic shift lever.

Many(no brands mentioned for obvious reasons) will start costing a lot of money shortly after warranty elapses. Sometimes age is a factor as well as miles."
293,"February 25, 2014 1:06PM",Mr_Shiftright,"Basically you pump compressed air into each cylinder (top dead cener) with a special gauge and measure the % of leakdown (air leaking past worn parts). A variation of 10% between cylinders is probably not acceptable. THEN you actually listen for where the air is leaking...if you see bubbles in your coolant, you have a head gasket leak--if you hear air rusing out of your intake, you have intake valve or valve seal or guide problems; if you hear out of the exhaust pipe, you have an exhaust valve problem, and if you hear air coming out of your oil filler cap or dipstick hole, you have ring and piston problems.
You can learn a lot from a cylinder leakdown test."

One other point; if you own your vehicles free and clear the lack of a car payment(s) will offset a lot of repair expenses. The average car payment is $460 with an average term of 65 months. I budget $500 per month for repairs/maintenance on all six of my cars."

298,"February 25, 2014 3:31PM",markcincinnati,"5,000 Miles Down the Road
A friend of mine, a marketing executive for a national software firm, always buys BMW’s and claims Audis are exclusively for “left-brainers” (I started out life as a computer programmer, so maybe there is something to that) because they appeal to technical types (tech-weenies, to quote my friend); you know these folks, those people who not only can create elaborate spreadsheets with impossible formulas, but also who can write actual computer programs as well. My wise-guy friend claims, even though Audi engines, transmissions and sumptuous interiors are either proclaimed by the motoring press to be “the best” or at least “tied for the top,” Audis remain soul-less machines, sorely lacking the all-important emotional hook to keep “serious” car people interested and perhaps entertained. They (Audis) are extremely competent and confidence inspiring pieces of machinery, but they somehow are not the stuff that inspires passionate prose – even though they are often the winners of three, four and five-way motoring press “comparo” reports.
Although I, apparently, am in the minority who do not doubt Audi’s soul can be seen, heard and felt in its cars, I now present an S4 update now that I have passed 5,000 miles – much of it being driven in sub-freezing weather and on snow and ice-covered roads.
The Audi in question is an Ibis white 2014 S4 Premium Plus model with the 7-speed S-Tronic transmission, 18” wheels shod with all-season tires, MMI/Navigation+, B&O audio, Magma Red Napa leather seats, carbon fiber trim, Audi side assist and Audi Care. I guess, perhaps I even wish, I would have gone for the Prestige model, now that I think of it, just for the articulating headlights. Of course now that I know how inexpensive the sport differential is, I should have insisted on getting that, too. With shipping and Audi Care, the pre-tax price was $57+K. As a member of the Audi Club of North America, I got an “automatic” 6% off the sticker, and as an Ohio resident, had to pay 6.5% sales tax. I put no money down and leased the car. I plan to buy the car and the Audi extended service package, if it proves itself to be as durable as it is fun to drive. I believe there is a way, too, to CPO my own car (for a price) giving me a warranty to 100,000 miles.
At 5,000 miles the first service – basically an inspection and an oil and filter change – is required, subsequent service intervals are 10,000 miles.
First off, the car has had no issues of any kind beyond a flat tire which only required a patch to remedy. Even on the coldest mornings (minus 11 F), starting was no problem and since I have heated seats there was only short-lived temperature discomfort. My butt was quickly warmed up, that is.
Second, the S4 with the S-Tronic transmission is beyond a pleasure to drive – it goes all the way to fun to drive coupled with a boatload of confidence inspiration. The engine, transmission, brake and steering combination work together so well they have convinced me they are telepathic, responding to my foot and hand commands in real time. There is no latency: Press the accelerator and the car doesn’t pause that millisecond every other car I have ever had did, indeed it seems to accelerate almost a millisecond before my brain receives the confirmation from my foot that the pedal has been pressed. The paddle shifters, too, act, they don’t react – when I ask for an upshift, the speed at which the next highest gear is selected is faster (and smoother) even than the best manual transmission upshift, I could ever pull off. And, I should also tell you that the brakes slow or stop the car with such speed and control it is as if I had hit a giant, super-thick foam rubber wall. Finally, the S4 goes where you point it, when you point it. Body roll is minimal and it corners like a Ken Onion chef’s knife carves a tender beef roast.
Other than the unabashed fart-like exhaust sound that accompanies high RPM upshifts, the S4 is very quiet and civilized inside, and the tuneage delivered through the B&O speaker system is sick – although I do miss the extra kick from the sub-woofer in the Acura TL’s DVD-Audio system.
This year, Drive Select is standard, and it allows, in Individual mode, the driver to change the characteristics of the engine/transmission, steering and exhaust system sound. Settings generally include Comfort, Auto and Dynamic. I have mine set for Dynamic (engine/transmission), Auto (steering) and Comfort (exhaust note sound), although under full-throttle, even in Comfort mode, the engine growls and the exhaust snorts right on cue whenever the transmission upshifts.
I have no intention of taking this (or my wife’s SQ5) to the track, but wrist-watch timed runs from 0 to 60 are, always under 5-seconds. To me, the S4 is a rocket in terms of its quickness; I’ll not be chipping this engine – it doesn’t need it. Time and distance take on entirely new meanings with an S4 – something I do attribute partially to the wonderful (Red) sport seats. Nobody does sport-seats better than Audi.
In sum, at 5,000 miles the already quick S4 engine seems to have found and made available about 5% more horsepower and torque from just above idle on to redline. I will look forward to repeating this “+5%” phenomenon again, if all goes as usual, again at 10,000 miles.
Perhaps because S4’s are not typically plentiful at your local dealer – there are rarely more than one or two of them at any of the Audi dealers I’ve been to over nearly three decades, they are “outta sight and outta mind” for many premium sport-sedan shoppers. This is a pity, for the S4 is that rare automobile that artfully combines, sport, luxury and a fair amount of practicality (it is in one of American’s most sought after configuration – a four-door sedan) in one fun package. If your auto shopping list currently includes an Acura TLX [coming soon], BMW 335, Infiniti Q50S, Cadillac ATS, Lexus IS 350 F-Sport, Mercedes C-class or Volvo S60 Type-R, you owe it to yourself to take a long test drive in an Audi S4. If money is an object, I would assume a great second choice would be the upcoming TLX, assuming Acura keeps the S4-lite theme of the current TL SH-AWD alive and well. Or, you could get an A4 S-Line and have many of the same goodies that make the S4 such a treat.
I’m getting the heck outta here now, while it’s still light out, and I’m going to take the long way home.

I never said anything about an older car with over 100k miles automatically becoming a money pit. What I said was that a well maintained car that age/miles will probably need a couple of repairs equating to a couple of car payments......maybe something like $1000-$1200 per year. That is very reasonable because one, there are no car payments. Two, insurance is cheap as it doesn't pay to carry collision on a car over 10 years old IMO. Three, you don't worry about it in parking lots so much anymore or sliding off the road on ice or snow quite as much. A little less stressful. Probably the most stressful thing is the worry of when the next thing is going to break and is it going to strand you or not. Doesn't bother me so much but I would worry about my wife or daughter having a situation."

You hit the nail on the head. You budget for repairs & maintenance. Most people don't do that. They pay a car off and don't think about what it is going to cost to keep it on the road for X more years. They just blow their former car payment and then either put the next major repair on a credit card or trade the car in and take out a loan on a new car.
A lot of people don't look at big picture things like total cost of ownership, instead choosing to focus on the monthly payment amount."

With the good cars, I OCD in a parking lot and go way away from other cars when possible. The TL has a few parking lot dings and a lot of scratches (patina?) already, so I don't think I would notice a few more.
as to repairs, in the last couple of years it has needed some unexpected ones. But, no collision on it (makes a difference when my 18 YO is the driver assigned to it). Hopefully though nothing big happens, since I want to get some more ""cheap"" use out of it before selling it at the end of the summer."

I've also set the speed limit alert to 80mph as its very easy to miss given the small readout- I've also found the digital speedo to be extremely helpful- I have the V1 hard mounted near the passenger visor as well.

315,"February 26, 2014 7:57PM",sweendogy,@stickguy I like the new feature to add pix- but badges really? I don't need no stinking badges....
316,"February 27, 2014 7:59AM",markcincinnati,"@sweendogy: I read an article about the ""individual"" settings that suggested the steering will perform at its best if set to Auto. I can't seem to locate the article, but I know it was in a fairly recent Car & Driver or Automobile or Road & Track, since those are the publications I subscribe to.
I don't know if I can honestly tell much of a difference, but for what it's worth, I set mine to Dynamic, Auto & Comfort (engine/transmission, steering, exhaust sound, respectively).
The primary (perhaps the ONLY) difference with the engine/transmission setting at dynamic is that the transmission will default to S mode which seems to hold in gear longer before upshift, perform obvious rev matches during downshifts and make the ""fart"" sound on upshifts more aggressive (hence my setting of ""comfort"" for the engine sound).
Now that I have passed 5,000 miles I am noticing better gas mileage, improved performance and a feeling of ""less friction"" overall. I had really missed the cruise control in the Audi -- when I set the CC to, say, 45MPH in the Acura TL SH-AWD and then find myself going down a rather steep hill seeing a curve at the bottom, the Acura would start freewheeling, so to speak and pick up more and more speed (based on the grade). Then, to negotiate the turn, I would have to brake -- which turned the cruise control off, of course. In the Audi, set the CC for 45MPH and go down a virtual vertical drop and the CC holds the speed at 45MPH, period. Then when reaching the base of the downhill, I can negotiate the curve without killing the cruise control.
It is a little thing, perhaps for some people. But my 2005 A6 and 2009 A4 had this feature and my 2011 Infiniti and 2012 Acura did not -- it seemed [on those Japanese premium cars] like a huge oversight.
Another thing I like about the Audi CC is if you've set it, say, at 75MPH and you come into a heavily monitored construction zone where the speed limit is reduced to 55MPH, you can toggle the CC stalk to 55 and the car brakes and resets itself at 55. With the Acura, for instance, you could only coast down or apply the brakes yourself.
I know there will be folks who are dead set against the car having this much ""intelligence"" or autonomy (and this ain't THAT much, folks), but it can simply be turned off if you don't want to ""enjoy"" a tiny bit smarter cruise control.
In any case, I keep forgetting just how much technology comes with these German cars -- and how it does its best to help you not get ticketed and remain in control. I give this feature alone an ""A"" for its contribution to safety.

319,"February 27, 2014 1:10PM",markcincinnati,"The Audi's backup camera screen shows trajectory lines that ""curve"" as the steering wheel is turned. The Acura? Straight lines, no curve, no match to steering wheel inputs.
Now, the Infiniti, it had front camera and rear camera and trajectory lines when the car was in reverse and drive -- of course, it also had the wonderful, fantastic, gotta have it, around-view monitor. Of course now both Audi and BMW offer this tech, but it is still not universal.
Of course, I recently read an article about how many times backup camera adoption has been pushed to a future year -- I guess we should feel good that the German and Japanese (premium) cars typically come standard with such tech and that it is pretty much ""available"" on the lesser cars from that mfgr.
Looks like backup cameras are ""probably"" going to be required as of January 2015 -- but don't hold your breath. By the time the backup camera is a requirement, the all-around or top-view systems will be the norm in the premium segment.
If you've not seen what an all-around top-view, etc, set-up can do, check out your nearest Infiniti showroom -- this is seriously cool tech that makes driving and parking in tight spaces, oh, only about a MILLION PERCENT easier and safer!
I graduated from college in 1973 (yep, I am old) and I took a course in 1971 where a new technology was introduced (in a Chrysler, no less): anti-lock brakes. 1971. Let that sink in -- the first car I was personally aware of that could actually have ABS as it came to be called was a 1985 model year BMW ""7"" series which, as I recall, came to the US market in calendar 1984.
What in the wide-wide world of sports took 13 years [for anti-lock brakes] to go from Chrysler (std equipment on the gas-turbine car they produced) to BMW (probably sourced from Bosch). The year following, ABS was offered on the Audi 200 (US name 5000S) quattro (and probably the FWD version too for that matter.) Yet, when was it that mere mortals could get ABS on their Blue Ovals and Bow Ties? It seems like it took decades!
Of course it took another automotive eternity to make ESP widely available, too. To a certain extent Audi took a helluva long time to bring ""torque vectoring"" (aka ""sport differential"") to market -- doing so, I believe, sometime after Acura announced their version of torque vectoring with the mouthful of a name -- SH-AWD.
I've had ABS, ESP, TPMS, sat nav, voice activation, blind spot monitoring, bi-xenon head-lights (except for the Acura), back-up or all-around view cameras and monitors and a whole host of other ""ought to be standard equipment"" stuff for longer than I can remember (and it is not -- yet -- due to a fading memory); this stuff is very cheap to make and probably all of this technology can fit in the space of one chip, with room to spare, these days. Why does the trickle down or even just the offering of the technology move at glacial speed for pity's sake?
Another technology that ""ought to be standard"" is the 7, 8 or 9 (or more) speed transmission. I believe a base 4-cylinder 2010 Audi A4 was offered with an 8-speed tiptronic transmission; and, I believe every or virtually every BMW can be had with an 8 speed unit, too. The 8-speed's reason for being is economy and performance, yes? Why didn't Chevy -- to name one -- do what these Germans did: go to ZF and buy the 8-speed units and tout their benefits in their brand new Impalas and SS's and, same question for Ford. The efficiency and performance gains alone should have made this worth doing -- instead we've got a whole bunch of new ""made in the USA"" cars with ""old"" 6-speed transmissions.

I thought Lexus was the first manufacture to come out with the 8 spd in the LS430. I do agree with you Mark that US automakers really needed to see the benefit of the 8 or 9 spd auto. I know that my BMW wouldn't be as lively if it had the old 6 spd steptronic."
322,"February 27, 2014 8:26PM",Mr_Shiftright,"That's right--1971 Chrysler Imperial had ABS on all 4 wheels. And apparently, it worked quite well."
323,"February 28, 2014 8:19AM",markcincinnati,"Glad to see ""us"" scratching our heads wondering why the nearly 13 year gap between working ABS in a Chrysler (I think it was only 2-channel ABS, but hey it worked) and the German's putting it in their top of the line models. I had a 1986 Audi 5000CS quattro and it had ABS -- indeed, it had an ""off on"" ABS switch on the dash. The owner's manual explained when ABS worked and when it was best to turn it off.
Of course they took the switch away when they found out that sometimes people would turn ABS off at inappropriate times because they thought there was something wrong with their brakes since they ""pulsed"" when ABS was activated.
A case of ignorance winning out over technology.
According to the owner's manual, you should turn your ABS off when driving in deep gravel or deep not packed (fluffy) snow, since you could use a locked wheel/tire to slow you down in deep gravel since a mound of gravel would pile up under the tires rapidly shedding speed. The mound-ing effect was cancelled by the action of the ABS, making the stopping more difficult in deep snow or gravel.
In any case, my confusion and perhaps even frustration is with the slow adoption of tech that is actually very inexpensive. And American mfgrs are some of the worst offenders. Hell, they'll jump on putting power windows in an el cheapo car, but delay for decades incorporating ABS, ESP, blind spot monitoring, etc etc etc. I would assume the cost of the hardware for power windows, power sunroofs and power door locks is more than the cost of a backup camera and blind spot monitoring, for example.
I'm pretty confident that the reason for the delay has something to do with perceived demand, costs and what the mfgr must see as their customers' perception of the value of such tech.
To me, this [safety and/or performance and/or convenience] tech is almost essential any more. Even though I think factory sat nav is outrageously priced, I wouldn't leave home without it -- but c'mon to add ""MMI"" to an Audi is $3,500 -- and for that you get sat nav, bluetooth and voice activation of several of the car's systems -- all nicely integrated. This has to provide Audi with a super high gross margin -- and, even knowing that, the majority of cars my Audi dealer sells (which are overwhelmingly Q5s and A4s) come with MMI, ""because that's what people want.""
Maybe things like ABS, when they were a $500 option, just didn't seem sexy enough, no matter how little it cost. Of course, now we're moving into a whole new era of auto tech -- autonomy. . . .

324,"February 28, 2014 11:56AM",dino001,"I think the issue was perception of safety as a priority. At that time it was not not perceived as such and stereo or power windows sold well, whereas ABS or airbags were considered ""fluff"". There were many examples of drivers choosing entertainment, or convenience options over safety when it was done as an alternative of ""free upgrade"", or simple limit of total price. It changed today, but it is still expected to be ""free"". In other words ABS or stability control should be ""free"" (i.e. included in price that is same as last year model), but leather or premium stereo, no problem as an option.
To best see how peoples' preferences changed is to watch evolution of Toyota cars. Toyota has almost six sense, when it comes to timing standard inclusion of equipment in the model vs. market demands. When Toyota offers something standard, it means the segment requires that as such. When it is still an expensive option, it means people will either be willing to pay extra or so without it. Detroit (GM especially) had an opposite problem - wrong timing. They'd put something on when nobody saw that necessary (e.g. ABS on Cavalier), but later they'd remove it when market was just about to demand it."

To be fair though the American companies have introduced a lot of technology in the lower end of the market first ( Chrysler with at least a driver side air bag in pretty much every car they sold way before anybody else put them in standard) and GM with ABS in the Cavalier as already mentioned, and I think they were one of the first with traction control as standard in some lower end cars as well ( grand ams for instance). At least there is no longer an Americans car to hat I know off that still comes with a four speed transmission ( unlike Toyota). The eight, nine, and ten speed transmissions are coming from the us manufactures, but it takes time to not only develop them, but to get suppliers to make the parts, and factories tooled to get them built, and to figure out how to make it cost effective to put them in lower end models, they aren't free after all. And why just pick on the American manufactures, where are the eight + speeds in the Japanese ( and even the German ) mainstream line up, some of them still only have 5 speeds in most of their line up. And Chrysler is the one who is offering eight and nine speed transmissions in their lower end cars first, so it is a little unfair to say that the American manufactures are putting technology in their cars, on the other hand I do agree that their high end models ( I.e. Cadillac and Lincoln at least) should have had this technology within a year or two of it appearing on the German makes, and I don't recall that happening so in that respect you are correct."

My previous A4 had the 19"" 35 series tires (and the sport suspension, too) -- you were aware of every grain of sand on the road. The 18""s are 40 series, which are somewhat better since the sidewalls aren't quite as stiff and there is a bit more cushion between you and the road, given the higher/taller aspect ratio.
The potholes here in Cincinnati have multiplied like rabbits this year -- I dread the almost unavoidable consequences of hitting one. Last time I did that it cost me one new wheel and four new tires. On an Audi, everything is breathtakingly expensive. We're talking a number beginning with a 2 -- yikes! Damn potholes.
When I cruise down the highway with these tires, there is very little road noise and, being that the tire sidewalls are only stiff, not super-stiff, the ride is actually not an issue. I do, however, have the upgraded seats, which probably account for part of the comfort, too.
You're right, when you put the car in Sport mode and use the paddle-shifter to blast up and down the highway, the thing really feels like a sports car. The paddles, in fact, in this car, provide the only ""instant"" shift I have ever experienced with any car (I love the S-tronic trans.)

376,"April 14, 2014 1:59PM",markcincinnati,"Acura TLX
There are (were) many good things to be said (and enjoyed) about the current TL SH-AWD (in Advance trim) -- trouble is (was) I often found myself ""apologizing"" for the Acura's styling and ""cheap looking"" (for the class it was aspiring to compete in) ""over-Honda-ized"" interior.
The concept version is quite the step up in the styling department; but, I think the same can be said for the Infiniti Q50, too. And, well, talk about piling on -- the Q50 can't get NO love from NOBODY, well maybe a little bit from Popular Mechanics.
I did then and still do today liken the TL in SH-AWD Advance form as Acura's S4 (for a lot less $). Now that I have a '14 S4, I do appreciate it [the S4] even more -- but the inherent goodness of the TL SH-AWD remains and, hopefully, will continue and grow in the updated TLX. If the price of the TLX SH-AWD Advance can stay under $50K, it ought to be a winner just so long as it [the TLX] doesn't lose the performance bits and driver involvement of the outgoing TL (this -- reduced driver involvement -- seems to be the main complaint about the Q50, as I recall).
I had thought Acura had all but given up wanting to compete with the premium Germans and the other premium Japanese offerings. It would seem the TLX could knock the Q50 to last place and maybe even breathe down the IS 350's neck (assuming the Acura in FWD trim is not compared with the IS in either rear or AWD configuration).
Perhaps things will get interesting again -- it was starting (for a while there) to look like the IS was going to be the only current Japanese Premium sporty sedan. This new TLX SH-AWD could turn the corner and the tide for that matter.
I'll probably not make any friends for saying this, but: in this class (A4, 3 series, C Class, ATS, IS, Q50 etc), there should be NO FWD only models (unless and only unless a customer wants to special order one). Yes, I know the A4 is offered in an FWD configuration (somewhere) -- but of the 5 or so Audi dealers I am aware of there are NO, ZERO, NONE, NADDA, FWD A4's (I don't even know if you could order one if you tried) available and the dealers have no intention of ever having one (again, assuming you can get one, even.)
The new A3 and the new ""baby Benz 4-door coupe"" may come as FWD models and the dealer body may elect to stock a few to attract more potential (and younger, perhaps?) customers, and that is fine. But at the ELLPS (Premium models) RWD and/or AWD are expected -- and here in Cincinnati AWD BMW's look to overtake the RWD versions soon if they haven't already (and the AWD trend is thus in Mercedes, Cadillac, Infiniti and Lexus for many models).
Having the TLX offered with FWD makes a statement -- something like ""take the 'P' out of ELLPS."" I would think it is a message Acura doesn't want to promote (given the overwhelming success -- he said sarcastically -- of the FWD RLX.)
In our fair city, the Honda dealership is ""real close"" (geographically) to the Acura store -- I would think some would shop a Honda after seeing the sticker on an FWD TLX. The TLX needs to make at least good run at being a performance model -- and it will be hard pressed, today, to do that as a front driver.
Of course, I could be wrong -- just not uncertain.

Of course, the proof is in the pudding. We won't know what it's like to drive until they hit the streets (May?). My dealer usually has big, invitation only rollouts with fanfare when a new model comes out. They have a string quartet, champagne, canapés, etc. They then have some of the new models for brief test drives. Last one I did was for the RLX (another nice car that's getting little love).
You're an Audi aficionado. I'm a little jaded because of what happened with mine. That shouldn't detract from your obvious love of the ones you've had, and continue to have.
I'm an Acura aficinado. Through BMWs, Audis, Cadillacs, etc, my Acuras are still among the best cars I've ever owned....and, like you, I've owned quite a few.
Your Audi is based on a FWD architecture. Yes, Quattro alleviates much of the FWD understeer. Still, day=to-day driving? You, me, anyone else would be hard pressed to say which wheels are motivating the car. They've become quite good at taming those bugaboos.
On paper at least, it looks like the new TLX will have what the Acura folks have been clamoring for.
While the 4 cyl will get the lion's share of volume, I'm more interested in the SH-AWD version, as always. Sticking to the formula of Good/Better/Best (standard/Tech/Advance) I just confirmed with the dealer that the Advance I'll be looking at will come in right around that $49K range (current Advance is $48K and change).
0-60 in 5 sec, Torque vectoring AWD, upgraded materials everywhere, lighter, LED headlights/tailights, high zoot stereo, sports leather seating, blind spot warning, integrated NAV that actually works right (and Siri enabled to fully integrate my iPhone), a little bit of this, a little more of that, at that price? Yep, it's at the top of my shopping list."
379,"April 14, 2014 7:00PM",dash5,"For me the TLX looks great on paper and I like the styling of the prototype. There were a few spy shots that were not very flattering, but overall I'm happy with what I see so far.
The next big hurdle is the interior. I know we'll see that this week at the Auto Show here in NYC, maybe I should stop by myself come to think of it!
Having looked at a TL in 2011 when I was last in the market, the interior, beak and that... boomerang thing... on the trunk, drove me away. This time they're seemingly on the right track."
380,"April 14, 2014 7:25PM",markcincinnati,"Is there anyplace (on the web?) where the number of FWD vs Quattro Audis sold in the US can be found? I've been to Audi dealers in Dallas and there were NO FWD cars other than a TT and the previous model A3 on the lot -- AWD appears NOT to be a regional issue. The highest performance Porsches and Lambos (and even some other Italian exotics) are AWD are they not?
I know that I am an Audi-biased and even German car-biased person, but I would really like to know if there are any significant number (%) of FWD Audis of any configuration sold in the US -- something (maybe emotion) tells me the number of FWD A4s, 6s. 8s, etc sold are in the single digits (%). I think it would be difficult for Audi to have achieved -- after decades and the unintended acceleration setback -- Premium status if the cars were in any significant volume FWD. This FWD issue is a problem for Acura.
In the ""old days"" you needed to at least have ONE V8 in your lineup to be considered Premium; these days volumetric efficiency seems to have become an acceptable alternative to displacement, but there are Premium class identifiers that Acura seemed, for a time, to embrace and recently they seem to eschew.
They may very well be reliable and durable, but they need to be more difficult to be distinguished from their more humble Honda roots. Audis, for years, were often said to be ""higher cost Vw's"" -- an A4 (called an Audi 4000 on this side of the Atlantic) was somewhat of a hard sell compared to a Passat (called a Quantum) when the Quantum had an Audi 5 cylinder while the Audi had to settle for a four-cylinder. Only when Audi decided to de-VW its cars did it begin to get the respect and pricing power to be in the premium class.
Acura has (until today, hopefully) had way too much Honda in their cars -- placing them at the same place Audi was about 20 years ago.
It's time for Acura to get serious, eschewing FWD in the TLX would be a good start-- Acura needs to piss or get off the pot, in crude terms, to be blunt.
Of course, well, you know . . . . but never uncertain.
Drive It Like You Live."
381,"April 14, 2014 7:45PM",dino001,"It is regional, for sure. A local Tampa dealer once told me a few years ago that they sold mostly FWD cars, by units anyway.

382,"April 14, 2014 7:53PM",dino001,"Just looked at local dealer inventory. It is a sample of one, one point of time. The A4 on the lot are 2:1 for AWD, so it seems its market share had already crept up."

Not only is the 1.8T down on HP and torque, but it also guzzles more fossil fuel than the 2.0T. And that is DESPITE the weight and efficiency disadvantage of the bigger engine and Quattro vs. FWD. The 1.8 FWD needs to be retired."
384,"April 14, 2014 9:31PM",stickguy,"where are you getting this on the 1.8? It isn't the old 1.8T motor, it is the new one that is in the Jetta and Passat now. Which is rated quite a bit higher than the 2.0T in the same model. a little less power true, but not much slower and does run on RUG."
385,"April 15, 2014 5:03AM",graphicguy,"Mark....The FWD A4s and A6s are price leaders. And, as has been mentioned, it's also a regional thing, too. In the sunny states, it's a rarity of find 4WD/AWD anything. Fact is, any Quattro A4/6 has it's beginnings as a FWD platform, just like SH AWD Acuras have their beginnings on FWD platforms.
I did rent a Jetta earlier this year. There are similarities to Audi...certain switches, handles, styling (especially the center stack and dash), etc. However, this is true for many brands. I don't see GM making different window switches for Cadillac when they can use the ones from Buick, just as one example.
Is a Honda a ""humble"" basis for an Acura? I dunno....depends on how you look at it. An Accord is certainly a very good starting point for an Acura.
I'm excited about the upcoming TLX. As I normally do, if in a couple of years, I decide to make a trade, the TLX will be tops on my list.
That's based on my experiences with both the S4 and the TL SH AWD. Does that make the S4 a bad car? No, not by a long stretch. It didn't work out all that well for me, and that may mean I have my own biases. But, that shouldn't and hasn't dissuaded you.
We'll wait and see what is unveiled today. I've seen the prototype pics. Acura is pretty good at sticking to pre-release versions of their production models. I like what I've seen. Then again, I liked the previous design, too.
5-sec 0-60, SH AWD, torque vectoring rear, 9 speed trans, Honda reliability, coming in at roughly $10K less than either a 335i or S4 equipped like for like, there's lots to love there."
386,"April 15, 2014 5:47AM",markcincinnati,"Do the Manufacturers read our rants and raves?
I shared the story of the S4 that couldn't (or wouldn't) be made right with my lawyer wife. The first thing she said was ""doesn't someone from Audi read the comments on Edmunds and Audiworld?"" She elaborated that it appears that it would be less expensive to have simply replaced the un-fixable S4 rather than have the story be posted in no small amount of detail on the web.
My own questions have to do somewhat with the dealer -- who was paid at the time of sale and is paid for warranty work. You'd think the dealer, who apparently is not losing any money on this customer would be interested in going the distance to get the customer's issue resolved. If the dealer was bleeding dollar bills, I could almost understand their reluctance to throw more money (mostly represented, I would assume, by time) at the problem.
Audi (and others) must have interns that read our posts, maybe even computer programs that comb the Internet looking for keywords (the Audi spiders?) and bringing stories to the attention of said interns. Unless they don't have such interns or programs, it would seem valuable -- in marketing terms alone -- to have addressed the ailing S4's issues rather than seeing them escalate to the point that the customer gives up in frustration.
I mean it was not like there were ""attacks"" or rants (without substantiation) posted; no name calling, etc. So for the wholesale cost of a new car the customer good-will would have, I can imagine, offset the ill-will and frustration laid out here for all to see.
The question stands -- do the manufacturers have folks who monitor what we write about their products and when there seems to be a less than positive issue, intervene?
On the subject of separation (by Audi from VW or by Infiniti from Nissan, for instance), it does indeed appear that when the Premium car maximizes its separation from the more humble ""parent"" they both win. Porsche, still in not very old memory, was building a number of cars that shared way too many VW components -- and those cars were damn near crucified by the motor reviewing press (and customers). Porsche virtually stopped this practice and the market responded positively.
These days there are still parts sharing (between and among car company's cousins), but when the Audi division began to separate itself further and further from VW, Audi's market and machines improved significantly. On the other side of this, Infiniti's G is born with RWD, I know of no Nissan analog, ditto the M -- but the JX was brought to market so quickly Infiniti had to base it on a Nissan product (FWD no less), and despite the JX's success (or lack of), it is probably not one of Infiniti's shining moments in marketing or manufactuing.
BMW has no sub-BMW division or parent which can be said to be a strength, but also may put BMW in a precarious position in the future as we see the global consolidation of car companies gather momentum.
Once there were 88, soon there may only be one-quarter that number [sic]."
387,"April 15, 2014 6:52AM",graphicguy,"Mark....you're preaching to the converted. It confounds me to no end the lengths some car manufacturers will go to keep from finding their products at fault. The recent GM ignition switch debacle is just the latest. IF you have a problem, fix it. If you can't fix it, replace it. If neither of those work....""here you go Mr/Ms customer....here's a check. We're sorry for the inconvenience. We hope to see you again under better circumstances"".
I think in my case, it was the Regional Rep who really was the ""putz"". While I had electronic gremlins that could have been alleviated with new ""parts"" (ones which they made a point of telling me were uber expensive), the really bothersome issue was the Quattro binding. I drove with them. They experienced the issue....admitted as much. Something electro-mechanical was amiss. After all the potential ""cheap"" fixes were exhausted, they turned to the mantra ""just bring it back when it totally leaves you stranded somewhere"".
2nd problem was how they drug their feet in making a decision on how to proceed. Yes, I had their loaner cars. But, I wanted MY CAR. Then, the Regional Manager tried to do a dance around the issue, denying any problems whatsoever (regardless of the obvious, clearly demonstrable issues).
As the old adage goes...""you only get one chance to make a good first impression"". Audi kind of blew that with me.
The two companies that I've had the utmost positive customer service with has been Acura and BMW. Probably more of a reflection of the individual dealerships than anything else. But, both have gone out of their way to make sure I was happy with my ownership experiences.
After years of not being loyal to any one manufacturer, it's becoming more of a priority for me to deal with the car companies that gives me the best customer service. Of course, to get me in the door to begin with, I have to like their products.
Again, no condemnation of your love of Audis. Your experiences have just been different than mine."
388,"April 15, 2014 7:43AM",dino001,"The short answer is no. The long answer is no. They don't care. As long as the sales are going up, they think everything is better than ever.
Regarding your dealer appearing disinterested in fixing your car, one possible explanation is that the manufacturer pays them just enough to break even on simple clear-cut issue (remove X, put new part back), but they may not get enough money to pay for diagnostic effort required when complex systems are involved. Then there may be manufacturers policy of putting head into sand when it comes to some issues, like MMI and such. If it's not direct safety (where they may get a big slap from media and/or government), they get less incentive to actually make it work. Moreover, complex electronic infotainment systems have a standing ""beta version"" stance. My observation is anytime software is involved, the sellers have some kind of indemnity - all those lengthy and unfair terms of use basically allow them to charge full price for a developmental product. So it goes like that: what da ya want - it's new, complex, it's gremlins, I dunno notin'."
389,"April 15, 2014 8:24AM",m6user,"I've seen many posts from GM customer service on brand specific Edmunds forums and I think also on the midsize cars forum. So, at least one manufacturer does read the forums. So the simple answer is yes some do. I'm sure some do but don't go as far as actually post. Now, why does GM do it and overtly at that? I don't know. One would like to think that they are trying to improve and/or fix product. But it may just be to cut potential lawsuits off at the pass. Obviously, it hasn't worked perfectly......much like their vehicles."
390,"April 15, 2014 9:18AM",graphicguy,"dino....you are so right. I can't remember how many times I'd call the dealer to ask the status of my repairs. After several days....the answers would be something along the lines of....""we haven't received instructions on how to fix your Audi"", or....""we're waiting for parts. Might take another week"". Or, ""we haven't been given the 'go-ahead' to fix your car"". How is this possible? The car was a year into the alleged ""bumper-to-bumper"" warranty. What's to authorize? You fix it.
One of the reasons I won't buy a Cadillac was the way they treated my late Mother. This was several years ago, but my Mother had bought an STS brand new. Granted, her only driving was to the hair dresser, the grocery store, the pharmacy, church on Sunday....LITERALLY A CAR DRIVEN BY A LITTLE OLD LADY.
It may sit for a day or two, but it was driven at least 3-4 times/week. It kept draining the battery. Cadillac dealer kept replacing the battery. A week or two after the new one was installed, it would go dead.
GM started doing the ""hokey-pokey"" with my Mother...blaming her for not driving it enough. So, she and I swapped cars. I drove her Caddy every day. Same thing happened when I drove it.
After having it towed yet again to the 3rd Caddy dealer to see if they could fix it, they authorized a new battery as the ""fix"". I asked the service manager if it didn't make more sense to do a diagnostics on the electrical system to see WHY the battery was being drained. He said all GM would reimburse them for was a battery replacement.
GM ended up eating that car after there was such a huge surge in the electrical system that the rear window defroster actually ""blew out"" the rear window after the surge.
When the buy back was authorized, I took the Caddy to the selling dealer as GM instructed. Dropping off the keys to the GM of the dealership, he said he wished he had never sold the car to my Mother.
Know what? So am I. That attitude has kept me away from the brand ever since."
391,"April 15, 2014 9:47AM",markcincinnati,"For the record, it [the Audi S4 issue] was NOT my Audi. As I have stated to distraction, between my personal cars, company paid-for cars and my wife's cars, we've had, er, 31 Audis in our garage since late 1977. They have not all been perfect. Yet, there has never been a problem that Audi has NOT stepped up and fixed (and only one time did an Audi factory rep take a look at one of my cars, and his response was to authorize all new rotors for my braking vibration issues.)
I am NOT suggesting that I know some inside information -- but how do we know the mfgrs aren't paying attention to these posts (and posts made elsewhere)?
I would think the almost 100% vertical ""rise in importance"" of social media would virtually dictate that the mfgrs monitor the WWW for blogs, rants, raves, posts, tweets and so on.
It just doesn't seem likely we are just chatting with each other and that what we say is not even some small part of the mix of ""market research"" and data points that so many companies covet and spend governmental sums to acquire.
We, all of us collectively (via ""the vivid awareness of the relationship between personal experience and the wider society"", C. Wright Mills), can [potentially] ""move markets"" -- especially and unfortunately somewhat easily in the negative, more so than the positive.
Imagine if ""we all"" wrote nothing but ""hater"" tales about the ""DeSoto"" -- you know, pick one car or car company (we could all pile on GM in light of its recent bad publicity, for example) -- that could be dozens (or perhaps thousands) of taste makers in a short time telling the world that ""this [DeSoto] product"" sucks, under-performs, costs too much, drinks gas or costs a young fortune to maintain and spends more time in the dealer's garage than the owner's, for instance.
I would think once what we wrote was posted here and subsequently quoted or re-posted on Facebook or any social media outlet of note, the crud would hit the fan. It seems ""obvious"" (to me) that the mfgrs must be observing what is being said and weighing the requirements to react and/or respond.

It's been assumed that, from the start of this thread, that ELLPS refers to models such as the 3-series, C-class, A4, etc.
Now that there is a 2-series (OK, this is a coupe only at the moment, but I figure the 2-series ""gran coupe"" is just around the corner), the CLA-class and the new A3, what do we call them? Are they the new ELLPS, and the old (larger) ones now need a new name?"
396,"April 15, 2014 7:59PM",sweendogy,Good question @michael@edmunds. I would say its always been up to the moderator- acura has had 2 cars here from the beginning and my argument was/is the tsx really Ellps? Obv the word sedan needs to be addressed but I think you need a pricing band- say 30-40k starter (obv that is a huge range but it's something) - and it has to be somewhat sporty - we can all agree the Lexus ES and other fwd rebaged cars should not.
397,"April 15, 2014 8:23PM",stickguy,"I think both can coexist, as long as the bigger models don't go too far upscale. So A3/A4, TSX/TL, are both close enough. Not sure there are really any others?"
398,"April 16, 2014 8:48AM",markcincinnati,"A3, CLA, 2-Series and who knows what else will come forth?
This forum, nominally, is the Entry-Level LPS forum. There is, of course, also an LPS forum. These names were fine when there was no CLA, A3, and etc. Now, we have more ""creep"" by several mfgs -- the new Mercedes C class is a big move up in its ""Premium-ness"", and even though the A4 (Audi's B class) was born in 2008, it too has upped its luxury content, and one can imagine that the upcoming calendar year 2015 A4 will take a page out of the A3's book and be pushed further upscale.
The new TLX (just coming to market) is, from the pictures at least, a big step up, and the same is the case (mostly) for the other ELLPS cars.
I never understood what justified the Acura TSX's inclusion as an ELLPS but I accepted it as a moderator's choice that just stuck.
A discussion forum here has a pretty wide latitude for discourse when there are multiple ostensibly competing cars to be commented on -- and that is fine with me. I do think, however, that the forums that include multiple cars should include cars that are typically cross shopped.
Example: I might have test driven a Ford Taurus SHO when I was looking to replace my TL SH-AWD; but this event was most likely an anomaly. The Taurus SHO is not an ELLPS by any definition I can think of, nor is it, despite its girth, a candidate for the LPS forum.
Therefore, at this point, the A3 and CLA and whatever else comes out BELOW the current A4, 3 Series, TLX, S60, IS, Q50 and so on should merit their own forum.
The other day, I was at my Audi dealer, looking at a heavily optioned A3 Premium+ (there is one step up from that , it is called Prestige, and one might argue the upcoming S3 might up the ante even furhter). The thing was somewhat MORE expensive than a stripped A4 Premium (quattro) model.
For the time being, perhaps, folks may cross shop the NEW A3 with the OLD A4 -- the replacement A4 however will, presumably, dissipate the overlap, if not always in price, certainly in its ability to be perceived as distinctly ""more premium"" than even the top o' the heap A3.
In any case, unless we want these forums to devolve into ""anything goes"", my vote is to put this new crop of sub-ELLPS cars into their own forum, perhaps something like Premium Sporty Compacts, PSC for short, or Sporty Premium Compacts, SPC, pick something, anything, just not ELLPS unless we make a new class in between ELLPS and LPS.

I had no problem with it being included because there are a lot of A4 w/ front wheel drive running around out west and down south that are very close on paper to a TSX. I know most people think of the Quattro when they talk Audi ELLPS but that's a choice of their own.

Looks like the tailights are the LCD ""lite pipe"" variety replacing my LED tail lights. That interior is gorgeous.
Saw some other specs....
0-60 around 5 secs for the TLX SH AWD (about 1/2 sec quicker than my current TL SH AWD). MPG is 21/31. I get 21 in the city, now. So, not sure that is an upgrade. But, if the numbers are right, I'm getting 28 MPG on the highway. If they can hit 31 MPG with the new trans, that would be great.
3.5L. 290 HP and about 270 TQ. That HP and displacement is less than my durrent TL (305 HP, 3.7L), but apparently the new 9-speed trans and weight reduction is attributed to the higher performance.
TLX multi-link suspension replaces my TL's double wishbones. Not sure about that. Will have to drive to see how that affects ride/handling.

411,"April 16, 2014 6:26PM",stickguy,The TL I like was the 2004-2008 vintage. I was behind one today (in my 2000 TL) and enjoyed the view. Also like the interior much better (plus I fit much better).
412,"April 16, 2014 6:38PM",sweendogy,@stickguy‌ - right on best looking was that generation - bmw and mb lovers like to use product codes- so the UA6-UA7
413,"April 17, 2014 6:20AM",dino001,"Agreed. The shield/beak front felt repulsive, at least at first. It kind of grew on a little bit, but was never in a beauty contest. TSX actually looked just a tad better in this beak thing than TL. I also liked previous TSX.
BTW, TSX was a perfect size for me. Similar to older BMWs and Audis. I don't really carry passengers, but I like four doors (actually five). To me back seat size is not as essential, as driving experience, which those shorter wheelbase vehicles provided. Unfortunately, all those names grew to sizes reminding their bigger brothers 10 years ago. I think the whole category really shifted. When you get something like optioned-out 335, A4 or soon coming C-class, they aren't really entry level, they are still ""sporty"", but not really ""sports"". Same would be with CTS, TLX, or others.
Unfortunately, their smaller siblings, which some would now argue as ELLPS, come mostly in FWD setups, which is off for traditionalists. It becomes fact of life. It is true that contemporary FWD is not your mother's FWD - current advances in torque handling made those cars much better to drive. Many have or will have AWD option and better engines, which mitigates some of the issue."

415,"April 17, 2014 9:46AM",laurasdada,"I owned an '05 TL for 6.5 years/85k trouble-free, fun and efficient miles. One of Honda/Acuras best designs imo (along with original Legend Coupe). Clean, elegant, sporty. I was so disheartened by the current design, did not consider it for even a moment. The toned down beak/shield is an improvement, but still wouldn't mind seeing it go the way of the Dodos... The TLX, from appearances, welcome back, Acura!
I""ve not owned nearly as many cars as I'd like (darn family responsibilities and fiscal conservatism!), but my '88 Integra and '05 TL remain two of my faves."
416,"April 17, 2014 2:28PM",markcincinnati,"I like the interior of the new TLX, and I wonder if not having a shift lever will be a plus or a minus in attracting customers. At this point, I don't have any experience with ""no shifter"" so I'll go with being neutral on the subject.
I am assuming the interior utilizes the upper and lower screen approach -- I run hot and cold on that, too, but probably more cold: I am more in favor of one screen generally speaking, but the TLX's interior does seem to send out most, if not all, of the queues that suggest it is a Premium car interior (an upgrade from my 2012)."
417,"April 17, 2014 7:32PM",andres3,"My experiences with Audi have all been positive. Every company can have a bad apple. The real goal should be to buy a vehicle that never gives a company a chance to establish their customer service levels, as you never have to visit them. That's what happened my first 4,100 miles in the perfect 2014 S4, but a day before I'm supposed to pick it up at the body shop, I'm told the dealer is finding the left front side of the vehicle out of alignment spec, enough out of spec that they can't adjust to meet spec.
The accident was on the right side; this could spell trouble. Not Audi's fault of course, the Lexus driver is at fault. I will say I escaped the ordeal without as little as a bruise; the belt did what it's supposed to do. I'm told the tow truck could have caused the suspension damage.
All the fluids had to be refilled & recharged (coolant, transmission, transmission coolant, AC system). The driver's seat belt has to be replaced (one-time use with significant impacts). The air box had to be replaced. Might end up being more than 17K when all is said and done; I think they should have totaled it; we'll see."
418,"April 17, 2014 7:51PM",Michaell,$17K in damage repairs is still only about 33% of the value of the car; not even close to the threshold used by most insurance carriers to write it off.
419,"April 17, 2014 7:56PM",andres3,"Yes, but when you add in Diminished value of around 15%, Rental Car expenses of about $1,250, and who knows how much extra could be needed before all said and done. And if the vehicle isn't quite right after all that effort; what then?

I have been in 5 accidents, 4 in cars (none my fault), one accident, I had to make a panic stop on I-8 west bound from La Mesa to Mission Valley, just picked up our truck from the dealership, truck was 6 months old, had 6K miles on, and a lady slammed into me at 65 mph, lucky for me, the truck was taller then her car, her insurance company was going to fix the truck, it needed a new frame, cost of said frame, $7900, then another $13K to R&R frame. My EX and I fought the insurance company to just total the truck, since the job was going to take roughly 3.5 months to complete.... So after 5 months (it took the dealership 2 months to complete the job) but each time I would take the truck out for a test drive I would find something wrong with the truck, after 5 months, of nit picking her insurance wrote a check for the truck. Andres3 be very picky and DO NOT sign a release unless you are 100% happy with the car, after a while, the adjuster might just say, lets forget this and write you a check... Doesn't your S4 have an aluminum frame?"
423,"April 19, 2014 9:28AM",Mr_Shiftright,"The problem isn't so much that the cars can't be fixed---they certainly can be made to look as good as new---, but that the insurance companies don't want to be trapped into, or locked into, supplemental repairs on a complex luxury car, weeks or months after the initial repair. So I think they assess the damage not only as to estimated repairs, but the type of car and the type of damage. You know, floods, fires, etc, give the insurance company pause."
424,"April 19, 2014 10:32AM",andres3,">
The S4 is a combination of aluminum, ultra high strength steel, and steel components. It appears the aluminum sub-frame of the suspension got knocked out of place affecting the left side though the impact was on the right. They said they were able to adjust it the 2nd day at the dealership to meet specs. I think unlike Toyota (in general), an Audi authorized body shop doesn't try to mess around and do things ""half-way."" There's only 3 body shops that qualify for ""Audi Certified"" in all of San Diego County. A good example is that on the first day at the dealership, they didn't try to magically adjust parts out of spec to meet spec. They admitted it didn't meet spec and worked on the car longer to get it right. In a way; this is a good thing; although my rental will now be around $1,400 due to the extended delays. I think they know the typical Audi owner is meticulous with attention to detail. After all, they didn't settle for a VW.
The body shop will get the car back first thing Monday morning, do a test drive by driving the vehicle back to the shop (what happens if they wreck on the way back?) After that, he said they had a good 1.5 days of work finishing up the buffing, polishing, and detailing on the panels that were repainted (a majority of panels by the way due to blending).
I hope I don't face delays like you did, because the more that is eaten up by rental costs out of the guy's $10K insurance limit, the harder it will be for me to collect decent diminished value.
When I told Geico to put what they told me over the phone in writing (that they'd defer to me to be made whole first from the 10K, then come in afterwards), they balked. They said let's wait and see what Mercury agrees to pay for DV and other things first, then we'll talk. I sent a demand letter to Mercury for 15% of the total purchase price $55K (including fees/taxes) = $8,250 for DV alone. I added a caveat that this was to settle fast and quickly without me having to pay professional appraisers and incur additional costs. I told them if they force me to go further, I will no longer negotiate the highest of my consultants estimates, whereas right now I might negotiate down a bit to just get it over with.
If there are ongoing issues with the car, I think now is the time to state for the record I thought the car should of been totaled from the beginning. At least then I can say ""I told you so,"" and your adjuster was off by somewhere near 25% (incompetent or grossly negligent estimate)."
425,"April 19, 2014 10:38AM",andres3,"Finally got the first supplemental estimate: Just north of $20K!!!!
Still, well below totaling even with 15% DV and $1,405 rental costs.
However, I find being off (first estimate was $15.5K) by so much, makes me think someone wasn't being honest with themselves early on. I know supplements are common, but one of nearly 25% extra? 28 day time estimate is way off too. Looks like it'll be 1 month and 4 days if they let me pick up next Tuesday."
426,"April 19, 2014 7:13PM",nyccarguy,"@andres3‌
Thanks for keeping us updated. Sorry you have to go through this whole ordeal."
427,"April 24, 2014 1:44PM",andres3,"So I got in a fight with my insurance company; I believe they've turned on me and they have 3 strikes in my book now. They found out the impacted tire wouldn't balance on the wheel and had to be replaced. They tried to get away with only replacing 1 tire saying the car only had 4,200 miles. I pointed out to Geico that they were deviating from the Owner's manual and Audi specifications that recommend replacing all 4 tires, but under no circumstances should tires be replaced in less than pairs on the front and/or rear axle. They must be within 2 MM to meet spec from front to rear. After sending a semi-nasty letter to Gieco, they realized the error of their ways, and said they'd pay for 80% of 2 tires, but 20% betterment charge to me (they are within the 2 mm spec.
20% betterment when staggered tires (2/32nd's difference) will result in reduced or at least altered performance? NO THANK YOU. Also, I won't get any betterment because I'm not going to double my maintenance frequency and hassle changing 2 tires at a time, especially when the manual says running different size tires (circumference) will result in reduced handling."
428,"April 24, 2014 3:00PM",m6user,If I were your insurance company I would have the tire shop shave a tire to match up with your present tires and tell you you're good to go. IMO asking for 4 new tires where only one is damaged when the car has only 4200 miles is a reach. Why would you have to double your maint. frequency if the tires are within the 2mm spec. anyway?
429,"April 24, 2014 6:59PM",sweendogy,"@andres3‌ we going to see picks of this pig? Would love to see the damage myself ?
Speed kills people stay safe.:"
430,"April 25, 2014 9:57PM",andres3,"They are saying I should pay a 20% betterment charge for getting two new tires replacing two tires that had 80% life left.
My argument is simply that since I want to change all 4 tires at the same time on the same rotation, the extra 2/32nd's on the front tires will provide me no betterment. I'm not going to delay changing the 2 newer tires when the older 2 are due for replacement just so I can eek out a ""betterment."" I will gain no benefit. If your always changing out your tires 2 at a time you are changing them out twice as frequently (in terms of shop visits and down time) than if you just change out all 4 at once.
I can assume and project all 4 tires will wear evenly since the car is AWD and all 4 tires measured at the same 20% wear."
431,"April 25, 2014 10:21PM",andres3,"Bigger problems than tires..... Got the car back yesterday afternoon. In a quick 15 minutes close eyeball inspection, I was able to find at least 10 things wrong with the car.
A small scuff/scratch on the black plastic windshield cowl, multiple black marks/paint blemishes on bumper edges/corners, a small minor white scratch that if not on the prior existing damage sheet, must of been caused during the shop's 38 day ownership of the car, a tiny chip on the roof, some rough slightly bumpy paint around edges such as around the fuel filling cap area, the underside of the hood has a paint blemish, and a general impression that orange peel is more prevalent or noticeable, but not bad, just not great.
I was expecting all that above and I'm sure most of that can be fixed in a 2nd trip to the body shop under warranty. However, I wasn't expecting the following:
Misaligned right doors (or at least the trim isn't lining up right) Haven't measured but I'd say around 3/16"" if I had to guess).
Lower Rocker panel fit and finish issues (increased gap, noticeable double sided sticky tape seeping through the wide uneven gap, paint blemishes at joint) They admitted that even with a brand new rocker panel, 9 new rivets, Audi's instructions, and new double-sided sticky tape, they've never been able to match what they do in Germany. They suggest it must be installed differently in the factory. Looks aftermarket now.
The exhaust was removed and reinstalled, and now both sets of exhaust tips appear to be hanging too low in relation to the back bumper diffuser, with the right two exhaust tips noticeably about 1/2""-3/4"" lower than the left pair of exhaust tips.
Number 3 bothers me the most. They say if what you can see is bad and lacks QC, then perhaps what you can't see is even worse. Oh yeah, and there's still about a 4"" piece of masking tape on the lower edge of the front right door (detailer should be fired).
On the other hand, the mechanical work seems solid; that's the bright side. The car drives and runs well (of course the dealership did a large portion of that work). I'd say the only thing I can tell that might be a tad ever so slightly off is the steering wheel might just be like 1 degree off-center; very close. When I eyeball leveling the steering wheel, the car will move slightly right, then again, maybe my eyeballs are off by a degree or two."
432,"April 26, 2014 9:13AM",graphicguy,"Andres....Just my personal opinion, but I think it's time to go to the insurance company and tell them you need a new car....for all the reasons listed. If they choose to fight (like with the tires, which to me is being rather nit-picky given all 4 tires should have the same tread depth), then you can tell them to give you a new car now, or risk having a car with a salvage title instead after you begin your proceedings."
433,"April 26, 2014 9:40AM",flightnurse,"I second it and basically stated that in my posting. When a car has a repair tag of 20K which included frame (sub frame) work you are asking for issues. Since the car is basically new, it would never be the same. Now I don't remember, who was at fault in the accident?"

When I told the adjuster and sent him 5 pictures of the first 5 things I noticed that were wrong (mostly paint scuffs/scratches/chips), he said Geico had paid the body shop, the body shop was my choice, and I'd have to deal with them on paint issues. Basically saying, you are on your own since you didn't choose one of our preferred shops, and our only obligation is to pay for repairs."
436,"April 26, 2014 5:06PM",andres3,"I'm liking the idea of having a new car as that's the only way I'll get back to having a German built and assembled S4 which clearly is far superior to one built and assembled in Escondido, CA.
The insurance company seems to think they are off the hook and I need to sue my chosen body shop. I did point out the windshield cowl was on them since it was never on the estimate, and they said they would pay for stuff if it was missed in the original estimates or supplements. How do I get them to see it as potentially their problem again?
How would I go about getting a salvage title if they don't cooperate? I am missing a few links in the chain there. I suppose my argument is that Geico and Mercury's adjuster's erred incompetently in saying this vehicle was repairable for 15.5K in 28 days. 38 days of rental for nearly $1,400, and $20.3K in repairs later, and we are where we are now. I do think I'll contact Audi and let them know this shop should certainly be DE-Certified."

What you are going through absolutely sucks dude. You are being picky and have every right to demand nothing less than perfection from the body shop and insurance company that is fixing a ""dream car"" for you with only 4200 miles which before it got hit was still ""brand new.""
Did you say they cut you a check for diminished value? It just seems at this point that you aren't going to ever be 100% happy with the car. Have them fix whatever else they can, then take the car to CARMAX, take it to a couple of Audi dealers, sell it or trade it in. Even with a ""dirty carfax,"" it is still a low mileage S4.

The rocker panel isn't that bad, its decent work, just not Ingolstad standards. After further review, I wasn't noticing anything else I hadn't already noticed in the first 24 hours (although there was one missed/rough/abrupt shift; not repeatable or duplicatable). If they can get my list right, I think I might just be happy with the car (besides, it'll take 3 to 4 months to get one just like it; as I'd have to re-order it from Germany again). This successful outcome of course depends upon Mercury paying me decent DV, and Caliber Collision/European Autobody paying for a premium rental while they do the RE-work on my list.
The car drives and rides well, so mechanically it feels strong; then again I was flopping around in a meager 4 cylinder Altima for a while and that seemed to pale in comparison to a new Accord, let alone an S4. Forgot how sturdy and tight fitting the seats were too compared to the rental fodder; reminds me to lose weight, or at least not gain any more weight.
The main thing that upset me was the low hanging exhaust that isn't symmetrically low hanging. This is a bad rolling on the road advertisement for Audi, hence why I thought the shop should be uncertified."

447,"April 29, 2014 6:21PM",markcincinnati,"My experience with insurance companies is that they will allow the ""victim"" enough latitude to take the car to a body shop that the victim believes will satisfy their needs to return the car to the status of ""like it never even happened.""
Here in Cincinnati, there is ONE body shop that has gone through the Audi A8 (aluminum) certification and actually sent their techs to Germany for training and then to Chicago for follow up training.
I would use this body shop for any car.
Oddly, my Audi dealer does NOT have a body shop, but the dealer is part of a billion dollar dealer group that has a body shop at each of their Cadillac and Acura dealerships.
If I go to the dealer with a body shop need, they used to take the car to the Audi A8 certified shop -- now, unfortunately, they trot it on over to the Cadillac dealership which does a good job.
Good really is the enemy of great.
I had a minor hiccup (a scratch really) and ended up ""demanding"" the car go to the certified body shop. The dealer complied but not before they offered up the Cadillac (or the Acura) body shop.
I had a trim piece lose its luster on my 2009 A4, and Audi agreed to send me all new chrome trim -- since it was under warranty, I let the Cadillac body shop do the job (and they replaced the trim without incident.) There was no body work or painting involved, however.
If you have any Audi product, I urge you to at least investigate ONLY taking the car to an A8 certified body shop -- they seem to have been indoctrinated with the ""doing it the right way"" and good is not good enough philosophy.
Only great is great, despite the extra cost (which is NOT paid out of your pocket, typically.)
I assume such a body shop would also be ""superior"" for any brand since the degree of care required for an aluminum body certified shop certainly seems to be a step or two above and beyond."

Germans nearly 4.5 months, 4,100 miles, and no tow trucks.
Americans assemble and build it and it gets 6 days before a tow truck is needed!
Geico says my problem is that I'm nowhere close to getting a total because the ""repairs"" are cheap in comparison to the car's value. That they have to be consistent, fair, and adhere to standards.

http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2015-bmw-m3-sedan-first-drive-review"
465,"May 12, 2014 10:26AM",andres3,I was able to average about 29 MPG travelling to Sacramento and back down to San Diego again. That includes miserable LA traffic. The S4 with the 7-speed dual clutch is the best drivetrain for my money. Love that mileage because I drive 80+ where possible.
466,"May 12, 2014 5:17PM",sweendogy,@andres3 amazing in comfort you can hover 80 and have the rpm under 2k - makes for a nice highway cruse
467,"May 14, 2014 10:54AM",andres3,"Maybe they changed the gearing for 2014's.... at 76.5 MPH I'm at 2K RPM in 7th Gear. At 80 just a smidge above, maybe 2,100-2,150."
468,"May 14, 2014 11:34AM",nyccarguy,"Switching gears to the current crop of ELLPS. I'm starting to see more and more MB CLAs & a few Audi A3s on the road. The CLA definitely has the ""Look at me, I'm driving a Mercedes"" look going for it. While the Audi is much more conservatively styled. I actually like the way the Audi looks. This new breed of ELLPS v 2.0 definitely keeps one well within the confines of a mid $30K price range which is great because the price point has definitely escalated of the traditional ELLPS since this discussion started."
469,"May 14, 2014 12:21PM",stickguy,"After checking out both at the auto show, I vastly prefer the Audi. And the 320i BMW over the Benz."
470,"May 14, 2014 12:45PM",laurasdada,"Same here, I was a bit underwhelmed by the CLA. Thought the A3 to be a handsome devil, however. A3 was on a pedestal at the NEIAS, so I could only admire from afar..."
471,"May 14, 2014 2:51PM",flightnurse,"For me at 80, I'm about 2150 also, Rick in the Genesis is about 2275 at 80. Now my vette at 80 was at 1750. At a 100 it was 2100..."
472,"May 14, 2014 2:52PM",flightnurse,"I don't think CLA is really going to work as well as Audi A3 or 320i. It has the looks, but that is about it. Haven't seen any in Phoenix or Tuscon, but in San Diego, I was surprised on how many I see."
473,"May 14, 2014 5:53PM",sweendogy,@flightnurse - you have an s4? Or is that the 320? The corvette might the perfect sports car for the modern age- it runs with anything - is cheap - 55k for 450 plus hp and 29 mpg highway - sick
474,"May 14, 2014 10:07PM",flightnurse,Hey Graphic what is the TL running? It's in my BMW.
475,"May 15, 2014 5:41AM",graphicguy,"FN....I'll have to look. Not quite sure what RPMs it runs at 80 MPH. I know the last road trip I took from Cincinnati to Chicago (with a little in town driving-10%) I netted 28 MPG (manual calculations). Buzzing around town, I get about 21-22 MPG.
I've seen a couple of CLAs around here. They're lookers. Sat in one at the local auto show. Not bad, but I wonder if an Accord doesn't have a nicer interior?
A3....a looker also. S3, probably more my speed (literally). Still trying to get over my S4 experience, though.
Still anxious to see the new TLX in the flesh.
And, NYC, I do agree. The ELLPS that are hitting the streets (CLA, A3, 320i, etc) are, generally speaking, an exciting bunch, given their price points."
476,"May 15, 2014 6:16AM",flightnurse,"Graphic, when it comes to cars brand means a lot. Look at Hyundai, Rick's Genesis is a perfect example. It has the same content as a E class and 5 Series and the price is that of a mid level 3 series. The ride is on par with a Lexus GS, but it does not have the star on the hood or the roundel. So people could get a Accord over a CLA but wont."
477,"May 15, 2014 2:24PM",andres3,"I took my S4 in for the 5,000 mile service (oil change and tire rotation) at Audi Escondido yesterday afternoon. I'm supposed to pick it up this afternoon, but they said with all the fires going on around San Diego County, one of them is close enough to them that they have been ordered to evacuate; so another day and night without the S4 it'll be. I halfway have my fingers crossed the whole place will burn down so my diminished value claim will be eliminated and I can just get a new S4
The 1,000 deductible will likely be less than my depreciation and diminished value losses, even after getting a check for diminished value, which could take a while with the speed of Mercury's decision makers."
478,"May 15, 2014 4:19PM",flightnurse,"Andres3 I was just in San Diego the flight out, I was in awe at all of the fires.. I'm hoping people will be safe. I remember the fires that Mt Laguna had in 1970 we could see the red/orange glow at night..
San Diego has had it's share of fires..."
479,"May 16, 2014 6:09AM",graphicguy,"FN....I think over time, and having had a fair amount of cars in my driving lifetime, it becomes clearer to me in seeing, feeling, and experiencing differences in cars. I'd be hard pressed to pick a CLA over a loaded Accord for less money.....especially given on just about every metric you use, the Accord seems to be the better car.
As you note, however, perception is reality many times. The Genesis is a perfect example of that. I've yet to hear anyone state they went from the Mercedes or BMW dealership over to the Hyundai store to cross shop the 5/E/Genesis. On top of that, the new Genesis is quite the looker in its own right.
BTW...was on the interstate last night. Got the TL up to 80 MPH. It was turning right around 2,100 RPM. While driving last night, I was thinking having had the twin scroll turbo in the BMW and the S/C in the Audi, while not as fast, the 3.7L in the TL spurs on quite well, and sounds expensive to boot.
Andres....stay safe!!!!!!!"
480,"May 16, 2014 9:48AM",flightnurse,"Rick is a Realtor, his main clientele are people looking to purchase houses in the 500,000 to a Mill homes. Most are driving MB, BMW, Audi, Jag's etc,, When he take them out in his car, they are all impressed with the Genesis on fit and finish, ride and comfort. Now has he turned any of them to sell their cars for a Genesis, I doubt it. The people who can afford these cars have been buying them for years. Mark is a perfect example, he is an Audi guy, I doubt he ever looked at a Genesis before buying his S4. This doesn't mean those who have bought a Genesis didn't have a MB or BMW in the past.
We all know that MB, BMW, Audi want the younger buyer, so if they are looking at a fully loaded Accord, then buying a A3 or 320 is within their reach..."

482,"May 16, 2014 5:27PM",sweendogy,On the accord / cla comments - I was also very vocal in the past as accord better then tsx and entre TL- I would Also say its prob better in v6 loaded form then the overly cheap 320- or as bmw likes to call it the leaser dream-
483,"May 17, 2014 8:12AM",flightnurse,"Mind showing where BMW has called the 320 a ""leaser dream""? I highly doubt they ever called it that..."
484,"May 17, 2014 8:19AM",andres3,"I like the TL, but I think the 3.7L needs a bit more juice. It's a fine engine, but I feel the weight of the TL and the larger engine when driving it. Also, the 6-speed auto seems like an antique, but it appears your real world mileage has bested the EPA estimates????
The main two problems I had with the TL were:
1) The exterior looks and style (or lack thereof)
2) The interior button layout and too many little buttons.
If they listen to my recipe, they'll have a real winner:
Boost HP and Torque 10-15%
Drop 300 lbs.
Fix the styling.
Better button quantity and layout.
More color selection (and better colors)
Boost EPA mileage 15%"
485,"May 17, 2014 10:10AM",sweendogy,"""Mind showing where BMW has called the 320 a ""leaser dream""? I highly doubt they ever called it that..."" Bmw would never call it that, true they want you to think that you are getting a great lux car - 269 a month with 3k down for 36m/30k miles. Seems sweet until you see the lack of technology, power, lux vs a honda accord."
486,"May 17, 2014 11:09AM",andres3,"Worse still the 320 means you are likely getting a ""lame"" loaner car as a courtesy vehicle while getting your ""free"" BMW maintenance done."
487,"May 17, 2014 5:25PM",flightnurse,"Interesting comment coming from someone who never owned a BMW, just for the record, my loaner was a 328d, which had M sport package. The dealership I deal with had X1's, 328i, 328d's and a few X5's. No 320i's as loaners."
488,"May 17, 2014 5:34PM",flightnurse,"The 320i is an entry level into a premium brand, just like the A3 is, however, the real difference is, the 320i isn't a smaller car like the A3 or CLA. It's the same F30 as the 328i which means you get a real back seat for two adults, something that the Audi and MB can not claim. This is what is setting BMW apart from Audi and BMW.
When it comes to leasing, the unknown will take the 3K down and $269/m deal, since if they went to a toyota dealer that is what they would have leased a Camry LE for."
489,"May 18, 2014 3:51AM",sweendogy,"We get the320 is a 3 series, I remember Infiniti had a g25 at one point- that didn't last for long. bmw is set apart because its competitive leases, not nothing more"
490,"May 18, 2014 7:49AM",Mr_Shiftright,"Possibly that impression of being a leaser dream comes from the automotive press, which has been sort of hammering the point:
""With a $33,475 base price, the 320i will allow BMW to advertise more affordable base-model lease deals, potentially with comparable pricing to second-tier competitors--Motor Trend
""BMW's new base 320i brings 3 Series ownership within reach of a lot more people than ever before"" -- LeaseBusters"
491,"May 18, 2014 8:52AM",flightnurse,"The interesting thing is people who know all about BMW leases can lease a mid level 328i for around $300/m. In fact, on Bimmerfest one of the Sponsor's which is a BMW Dealer has a great lease on a 528i for $465/m. A friend just did a Euro Delivery on his M235i, ZERO down, and payments of $502/m with tax, MSRP was $49K selling price was $45K.. BTW, yes these leases had 7 MSD's.. Which is the smart way to go.. I'm told Audi doesn't do MSD's which is ashamed it's a win win both both Audi and customer.
Now as I pointed out, Audi now has the A3, which will lease about the same.. Smaller car then a 320i..."
492,"May 18, 2014 8:56AM",kyfdx,Audi has an MSD program.
493,"May 18, 2014 9:38AM",robr2,"Except that the people BMW is targeting with a $319 lease deal on a 320i aren't the type that have the money to do multiple MSD's - they are going to have a hard time coming up with the $3800 needed to drive it away.
The A3 and the CLS are not targeted against the 320 in their base form - the real competition will be here next year as the next 1 series."
494,"May 18, 2014 9:42AM",flightnurse,"This is true, but people just need to dig a little and save a bunch.
So really there is no direct competitor for the 320i. I was looking at base price."
495,"May 18, 2014 11:20AM",dino001,It didn't stick because it had a pathetic engine and price and not enough price difference with G35/G37. From reports I read 320 engine is not bad at all and the pricing difference makes better sense.
496,"May 18, 2014 2:02PM",kyfdx,"I've leased both a BMW and Infiniti with payments in the $300s, and MSDs.
ELLPS aren't just leased by strivers, seeking to stretch their budget. Plenty of car enthusiasts, just looking for good value for their money."
497,"May 18, 2014 3:46PM",stickguy,"well, the 320 and 328 have the same engine. One is just in a higher state of tune. So like having a few less standard features, it really is the same car. Heck, 1/2 the people that get a 328 probably would never be able to tell if they got a 320i motor by mistake!"
498,"May 18, 2014 4:32PM",Mr_Shiftright,60 less HP though. I bet you'd notice
499,"May 18, 2014 4:45PM",kyfdx,"Yeah.. 180 vs. 240
But, when the E46 came in 325 or 330, the horsepower difference was 184 vs. 225. You could definitely tell the difference, but the 184 HP in the 325i certainly seemed adequate. I'm not a giant fan of the horsepower wars..."
500,"May 18, 2014 4:59PM",dino001,It's probably because the horsepower difference came mostly from better high end torque and longer rev range. This means Joe Sixpack will not see as much difference in his driving to a grocery store.

503,"May 18, 2014 8:57PM",stickguy,"not the same 1.8l. all new motor. Same engine as in my son's Jetta, and it is a really nice unit.
why? So they can keep the base price down, of course. and frankly, that is plenty of motor for that car."
504,"May 18, 2014 9:26PM",Michaell,I would agree. I'd love to see BMW come out with a 220i. I think 180hp would be adequate in that car.
505,"May 19, 2014 7:21AM",Mr_Shiftright,"True. You reach a point where the HP can not be legally applied anymore. You'd have to branch out into track venues to enjoy the car. 180HP is more than adequate, but it does depend on the weight of the car of course. 180HP in a MINI is not the same as 180HP in a Lincoln Town Car."
506,"May 19, 2014 8:35AM",rbirns1,"What lack of technology? Other than the detuned engine, what is missing from the 320?"
507,"May 19, 2014 8:40AM",Michaell,"I don't think that it's missing so much as it's optional. A base 320i has very few standard features when compared to a top of the line Accord. To get them equipped similarly, the 3-series will end up priced in the upper 30's."
508,"May 19, 2014 8:59AM",flightnurse,"The new 1.8l turbo is an all new unit and the reviews are very positive. On the VW side, it will replace the 2.5l 5 cycle they have been using. Better MPG and better power."
509,"May 19, 2014 9:02AM",flightnurse,"Power seats are standard on the 328i (wasn't before), folding mirrors are also standard. The premium package is really the best package to get on the 3 series, but in the 320i leather is a stand alone option, leather is part of the premium package which make sense to add for only $1300."
510,"May 19, 2014 11:59AM",roadburner,"I don't like that; I prefer manual seats. That said, bravo to BMWNA for offering a moonroof delete option on the M235i..."
511,"May 19, 2014 2:45PM",flightnurse,"This is why BMW has a la carte ordering system.. Sunroof is standard on the M235i, I too like that you can have it deleted if you want it."
512,"May 20, 2014 5:21PM",sweendogy,My point on technology was pretty clear a loaded accord with more hp and leather and nav kills a comp 320 in every aspect of tech as equipped- the Accord sport has power driver seat standard for 23msrp. Bmw no such luck- everything is an add on- I'm sure it's a bmw at heart but its expensive for a car with little standard. I wonder if this car is being crossed shopped vs bmw mini
513,"May 20, 2014 6:40PM",roadburner,"Depends on the buyer; the presence or lack of power seats, leather, and nav have no influence on my choice. Once I'm spending over $30K RWD and three pedals are my minimum requirements.
That said, having extensively driven several iterations of the F30 I have to say that it leaves me cold; I much prefer my Club Sport and '02, not to mention my Mazdaspeed 3- and this comes from someone who has owned BMWs since 1983..."
514,"May 20, 2014 9:47PM",flightnurse,"If you sole argument is technology then you should have bought a Q50 and not your S4... If someone wants a strip down Sports Sedan, which BTW, BMW is selling many 320i with just the Sports Package and 6 spd manual that is the way to go. Some people want a car just like it, others will load up the 320i with all options. One thing I give BMW over many other manufactures is, you can build your car how you want it."
515,"May 22, 2014 6:02PM",sweendogy,"@flightnurse - my whole argument was Price - 35k to get a car equipped as you stated- no sunroof - base stereo, no power seats or sunroof-select colors and no leather- missing 30 other items and same power as an 18k mainstream cruiser. When you say they are selling many? Where ?"
516,"May 22, 2014 6:48PM",flightnurse,"In your world there are people who don't want all that but want a Sports Sedan, so they order a 320i with Sport Package, with 6 sod man and they are happy. Then there are people who take a 335i and load it up to 63K.... There isn't a right or wrong answer here. it's all about personal preference. I remember you stated you would never buy a ELPS without a manual transmission, but look you have a automatic.
Dealers are ordering 320i's with Premium Package and leather, that seems to be the bulk of what is on lots. This isn't the lease that is all over the net, but someone who understand leases can get this 320i for roughly $250/m on a lease with very little out of pocket usually tax and fee's."
517,"May 23, 2014 5:28AM",qbrozen,"I agree $35k is alot of money... but, and maybe I'm forgetting something here, I believe the 320 is the cheapest RWD sport sedan on the market, regardless of luxury status."
518,"May 23, 2014 12:04PM",flightnurse,For the price point it's the entry level Sport Sedan that can he had with a manual transmission and sport package.
519,"May 23, 2014 6:31PM",sweendogy,"RWD sure - but you could get a more powerful german - that's an all around better sports car?
And the double jeopardy answer alex- what is the vw golf R?
car has more of everything in a nice German shell- except for the nice bmw ""free maintence"" and let's not forget about the lease deals and nice dealerships- the vw has everything a value oriented performance person would want in a 4 door.
And motor trends take -...(and to be fair they did talk it up a bit going into this ending blurb)-
""A $35,000 3 Series sedan sounds like a bargain until you learn what's not included. Extra-cost options on a sport package-equipped $34,775 320i include a rear-view camera, navigation system, real leather, enhanced Bluetooth, HID headlights, a moonroof, hands-free keyless entry, and an auto-dimming rearview mirror. Though the sport seats have two-way adjustable side bolsters, fully power-operated front seats are extra. Heated seats cost more, too, unless you consider how hot the black leatherette gets after the car sits in the sun for a few hours. Then there's the aforementioned $550 for a selection of metallic colors. We don't expect any luxury automaker to include all of the above options as standard equipment, but new-to-BMW customers intrigued by the 320i model but familiar with more value-oriented luxury brands may be taken aback by the fact that none of the above is standard.""

522,"May 24, 2014 11:23AM",sweendogy,"@roadburner @flightnurse - I ""agree"" to disagree - simple logic for me - if you pay 35k for a car why not compare to cars costing 35k and what you actually get/ or in the 320 case what you don't get. So ""I get"" the value of money. Just because you think its a great sports sedan doesn't mean its a great value. - as clarified by car and driver. I would also like to know how many 320s are being ordered with sport and stick- up east all Ive seen are awd and I'm assuming auto, dk about the sports package set up.
I like facts as well"
523,"May 24, 2014 11:42AM",tlong,"When I bought my A4 way back in '98, one of the reasons I bought Audi instead of BMW was that even though the prices looked similar, the BMW didn't have ANYTHING standard. Not even a folding rear seat. I see that nothing has changed. Once you content it up, add $5K or $10K easily. If you want more sport than luxury, BMW is good. If you want some luxury, too, there are better values out there."
524,"May 24, 2014 3:47PM",qbrozen,"That's certainly true. Could get a mazda3 with more options than a base 320 and even save a chunk of change. Still doesn't mean it is a good substitute for someone wanting a RWD sporty sedan, though.
It's really so simple. Different shoppers have different orders of preference. Some folks put tech on top, some fuel mileage, some RWD/FWD/AWD."
525,"May 24, 2014 4:36PM",stickguy,"funny thing though about the 320. People keep talking about it being a RWD, when in much of the country (at least the NE), almost every one at a dealer is an X drive."

527,"May 24, 2014 8:34PM",Michaell,"Is this the ELLS thread? Or the ELPS thread?
No!
Luxury and performance together.
We will never agree on what constitutes performance, or luxury.
Accord V6 will smoke a 320i - in a straight line.
Sonata limited comes standard with features you have to pay extra for on an A4 - if they are available at all.
We will all agree to disagree."

No hole in the roof? A MAJOR plus."
530,"May 25, 2014 8:46AM",Mr_Shiftright,"The very term ""luxury performance"" is tricky--in one way of looking at it, they are at odds with each other, in another way, why can't you have both in equal measure?
For some, having a howling engine and gobs of feedback through your ears, hands and butt are anathema to ""luxury"", to others, any car lacking such things cannot be regarded as a ""performance"" car.
I hate to bring up ancient history but in this case it might be relevant. When Mercedes first starting getting serious about capturing the luxury car market in America (by serious, I mean, large sedans, leather, wood trim, AC, automatic, plenty of gadgetry, plenty of power)--this would be in the very late 1960s, early 1970s---they ran into some serious marketing problems with former Lincoln and Cadillac owners.
What was that? It was a lot of complaints about ""these cars ride too hard"" and/or ""the shifting i too firm"" and ""the seats are too stiff"".
What the American drivers were experiencing was ""performance"" --excellent brakes, precise handling and a rational cockpit designed to help you drive fast."
531,"May 25, 2014 9:03AM",roadburner,"I have an E28 brochure from the early '80s that contains the phrase ""That unfamiliar sensation you are feeling is called the road."""
532,"May 28, 2014 1:31PM",markcincinnati,"Been so busy for weeks! Promised myself I would at least make a post when the '14 S4 reached 10,000 miles. Well, I'm about 400 miles away from 11,000 and I need to report to the collective that once again Audi has managed to build an engine that starts out strong, reboots itself somehow around 5,000 miles into a stronger (and more economical) version of itself, then settles in for another 5,000 miles before it again reboots itself into a noticeably more potent version.
My wife's SQ5 also has passed 10,000 miles and I am now fully able to discern the differences between her 8-speed tiptronic transmission and my 7-speed s-tronic.
In a nutshell: the 8-speed seems, to me at least, to offer the most balanced (of the attributes comfort and sport) presentation of goodness in ""D"" -- the thing is virtually always in its sweet spot in terms of torque on tap, although the downshift rev-matching seems to be, hmm, ""muted"" or somehow pushed out of the foreground. Conversely, the S4 in ""D"" seems hell-bent to hide the performance of the supercharged engine behind a penchant to always shift up a second or a second and half too soon. Also, the s-tronic, in ""D"" really doesn't seem to want you to notice when it downshifts as you are slowing down.
In ""S"" mode, the S4 can bear its teeth providing gobs of torque, a willingness to pull in second gear as if it were on a mission to pull a 100 year old tree stump out of hard dirt. Also, in ""S"" mode the S4 under even somewhat mild acceleration makes that delightful ""burp or fart"" sound upon up-shift, time after time. The s-tronic is a miracle of modern medicine in fact.
When I got into the SQ5 the other day, I felt the transmission attempt to provide velvety shifts (which it did virtually all of the time, except when I pressed it hard, not to). The slight differences in feel between the two transmissions are that the s-tronic can also provide velvety shifts, but they are just ""this much"" smoother somehow -- shifts that under light or moderate acceleration are more heard than felt. The differences are subtle when you're pressing lightly on the right pedal, but even the masterful Audi transmission programmers cannot completely make the tiptronic mimic the s-tronic's slick moves.
The sport seats in both Audi ""S"" models continue to impress with no break-in or break-down of any kind perceptible -- and, the interiors still look fresh despite the recent time I spent sitting behind the wheel of a Premium+ A3 (didn't get to drive it, however.)
The technology too is impressive, even though the choice of T-mobile as the in-car WiFi carrier (3G with very poor signal quality about 1/3rd of the time and 2G with even worse quality the rest of the time) impresses like a turd in a swimming pool.
I have repeatedly asked Audi for an upgrade to another carrier (AT&T, Verizon, cup and a string), I have to assume there is something that (for some fee) could be done to unlock the technology to get off of what has to be the worst cellular carrier ever (at least in SW Ohio). Of course when you get behind the wheel of a new A3 you notice NO T-MOBILE this time around. You can bet by 2016 all Audis will be divorced from T-Mobile. I'd keep my subscription if they'd price it in synch with its usefulness, perhaps $7.50 per month (in SW Ohio anyway). Instead they want $30 per month on a month-to-month basis.
That fellow ELLPS lovers is the only flaw in other-wise delightful pair of ""S"" Audi cars.
BTW - went to the Porsche dealer: finally they had ONE Macan S in stock -- hideous color combo, black on black on black (wheels), gawwd I thought goth was dead (I crack myself up).
However, we do want to drive the Macan to see how the SQ5 holds up against it pound for pound and dollar for dollar.
As always, drive it like you live."
533,"May 28, 2014 1:36PM",kyfdx,"Isn't the Macan a virtual twin of the SQ5? Same powertrain and platform, right?"
534,"May 28, 2014 2:03PM",markcincinnati,"Nope. Porsche engine, transmission -- lower HP and torque than SQ5 but offers the ability to option to over $90K with a super high output turbo V6 not offered by Audi.
SQ5 lifted ground clearance; Porsche ground clearance in ""hunker mode."" 33% of the Q5 lives on in the Macan. Offers from Porsche a seemingly price competitive version of the SQ5, if you play with the configurations possible, however, the Macan does cost more. The presumably typically optioned Macan S at the Porsche dealership (which owns the Audi dealership too) was about $64K. My wife's Prestige SQ5 was $63.5K or something close to that. An argument could be made that the Prestige SQ5 with several upgrades is still less ($5K) than a comparably equipped Macan S.
I would think, however, if you're looking at the two at sub $65K, the Macan may present itself as, well, a Porsche! And, even if the Audi is the ""deal"" it is still NOT A PORSCHE.
I would want to drive both and I would want to be fair with the option set up.
I am an Audi fan, to be sure, but the Macan could cannibalize the SQ5 -- not the mainline Q5's, the SQ5. Either Audi needs to up the ante (an RSQ5 perhaps) or be relegated to a rung lower in the giant pecking order in the automotive sky.
Funny, Audi has registered the name RSQ3, but as far as I can find out, NOT the RSQ5 -- can you say ""Marketing!"""

And we're not even getting into VW, Infiniti, and others, which also usually come with large year end incentives.
I know this forum is about Luxury Performance cars, but the fact is that the 320 simply is so dreadful in its base form that it's not even as nice as a Civic EX.

I would suspect, as a somewhat related example, that the Macan S might cannibalize the SQ5's sales (especially if there are Macans on the lot for under $60K), because the Macan is a Porsche.
My friend, thinking he had an a-ha moment bought a Passat CC thinking he got so much more than he would have gotten (in this case) in an A4. Now, the truth of the matter is that he may be accurate in his Consumer Reports Clinical assessment of the two vehicles.
Perhaps ""hate"" is too strong of a word, but -- he hated the CC -- because it WASN'T an Audi. Same story goes for someone who did the same kind of thing with a Nissan instead of an Infiniti, they couldn't wait to early terminate the lease.
Several additional data points are certainly possible for me to share with y'all -- but you probably have your own data points and stories to tell about someone who ""saw the light"" and finally got the Infiniti instead of the BMW and then, almost immediately, was pining for a BMW (which would have been seriously de-contented when compared to the Infiniti -- which cost less money too.)
I sat in (didn't drive) a maxed out Avalon and sat in and drove the Lexus ""ES,"" concluding the Avalon was mo' car for less money. Now, in my case, I have little if any affection for the Lexus brand vs the Toyota ) Avalon -- so I would think of myself as opting for the Avalon seeing no advantage to the Lexus that would justify an extra charge.
But, somewhere back in back of my mind, I know so many ""top class"" folks who practically worship Lexi, so were I to be faced with the choice, I imagine I would ultimately cave (and opt for the Lexus.)
Funny (well sorta), I'll buy Kroger Brand every time vs the national brand if given the chance and if the Kroger Brand (pasta for instance) is cheaper. I buy Costco shirts for crissakes, but I wouldn't own a Costco gas grill -- gotta be Weber.
The badges on cars and many other things (and yes we do need those stinkin' badges) are quite an important part of selecting, buying, financing and ""enjoying the ride"" [of the new 'sheen.]

No. The point is 4-doors + RWD + new. That's the equation we keep talking about.
I agree with the comment that the X1 > 320i. But, yeah, I guess it doesn't precisely fit the sedan category.
EDIT: I just checked on X1 pricing ... you can't get a 28i sdrive with a manual trans?? Ugh.
And its not just a matter of living with 2 fewer doors. Even if I cut 2 more holes in my Mustang, it would not make the back seat much more inhabitable. I can live with it because my need of the back seat mostly amounts to taking my 4-yr-old 3 miles to the daycare.

You have to admit that the 320 hardly could be called a performance car when many run of the mill midsize sedans have more room, power and bells and whistles than the basic 320. A lot of naturally aspirated I4s have more HP than the 320 and when optioned out are many thousands less than a similarly equipped 320. The two things that the 320 has going for it are the luxury nameplate and experience and possibly handling. I say possibly handling because the Mazda6 handles pretty darn well and has more HP than the 320.
So, really, one can say the 320 is an entry level luxury sedan but is lacking on the performance side. Heck, people on here used to complain that the TSX with a measly NA I4 with 200hp and shouldn't be included because it wasn't performance enough."

I know you are happy with your 320i. I believe you said you have even chipped it to make it faster for a not so unreasonable amount of money. I'm not knocking the 320i. I had one as a loaner once. For my daily driving needs it would suit me just fine. Around town I found it comfortable and docile. It rode smooth on the highway. I'm quite sure the current body style chassis is stronger and the 320i handles better than my 2011 328xi. I did find myself having to plan a little bit for passing maneuvers. I don't like the MASSIVE headrests or the giant screen stuck on top of the dashboard. I even think the 320i is a much better looking vehicle than the X1. I was simply stating that dollar for dollar, you get better acceleration on an X1 28i vs. a 320i and an X1 35i vs. a 328i.
I know that BMWs even in their ""base"" form are better driving cars than their competitors. Our 1st BMW was my wife's 2007 X3 that had 3 options: Heated Seats, Rear Privacy Glass, & Metallic Paint. We loved it. The fact that BMW offers a 320i with a dedicated RWD platform sets them apart from the competition.
I think it is amazing that a dealer stocks a 320i with a 6 speed stick & sport pkg. Around here, the cars all have X Drive and an automatic (I know why, I took my Prelude yesterday forgetting that it was a ""get away day""). A Sports Package around here with our Texas sized pot holes and crumbling roads is a no-no.
There are faster cars in the price range (Sonata Turbo, V6 Accord) for even less money. There are cars that offer more luxury features & gadgets for less money too. Just because they are faster, more powerful, and offer more gadgets doesn't make them better cars at all."

559,"May 30, 2014 1:56PM",tlong,"Honestly sometimes the snobbery stereotypes of BMW drivers are apparent even in this forum. Really, your car doesn't measure testosterone levels.
I'm not particularly a huge fan of BMW, but I can admire their vehicles and what they've done in the marketplace.
To me, being ""sporty"" is NOT about horsepower or torque. Sure, that's nice, but if that were what was important I'd buy a Vette or a Camaro. Straight-line acceleration is not what makes an ELLPS appealing to me.
I admire and appreciate, shall we say, ""precision"". I like precise, tight steering. I like a reasonably comfortable, yet firm and precise ride. I like going around corners, not at 0.8g, but in a way that the steering feel is precise, I know exactly where the car is going to go, and I can feel the feedback through the steering wheel. I don't even particularly care to autocross my vehicles or pull high g's in corners.
So I also like a ""nice"" interior. I can get fairly lower-horsepower, ""precise"" vehicles at reasonable cost (the Mazda 3 comes to mind). But those vehicles usually don't have the ""nicer"" interiors that I like. It was all of these thoughts and characteristics that caused me to buy an A4 in the late '90's. And now I drive an '05 TL, and you know what - although the interior is ""nice"" and the horsepower is quite good, the driving dynamics are still a bit too floaty/boaty and lacking.
So I DON'T begrudge somebody liking a 320i. It's not all about testosterone, or horsepower, at least to some of us. And it's not about snobbery, either. We all have different needs and tastes. Insulting each others' rides - well, pretty childish IMHO."

I would have been able to get more standard options with all other models, but none of them came close to the handling and nimbleness that was there in the BMW (my opinion).
I also looked at 328i (Sport line and no line). The 328i Sport line was definitely faster compared to 320i, but only if you went at it hard. In normal to mid range driving (which is what I normally do), I found really no difference. 328i without sport package felt too soft.

S5 felt sportiest of them, the DSG shifts made sounds like computer game. Its supercharged engine had phenomenal note. Benz was plush, well balanced, still quite quick. BMW had everything in great balance, the sports suspension was what I like. The exhaust note more throaty than I remember on 335 I drove during the performance delivery in Spartanburg. They also had 428 Gran Coupe on display. It's gorgeous. Back seat headroom is too small for 6 feet tall person, but the extra utility of hatch is great. Love the looks. Couldn't drive it, as that one was preproduction European model, even had manual transmission, not available for US market. It's definitely on my list, but I'm not rushing in to put a deposit down.
BTW, I had a great conversation with the product rep about some features. They reportedly changed the start/stop feature defaulting to last setting, as opposed to previous always going back to active.

I put every option that I could find on a Focus ST, plus the special paint, moonroof, and so on and got a Truecar price of $27K.
4 doors. Handles better, looks better, is faster. Almost 335i fast, in fact. Those full leather Recaro seats are also very comfortable, despite their color scheme. So if you want more performance, you have a better option for less money.
Or you can go the other way and want more luxury and better performance for the same money. Auto magazines compare the 335i and the G37 routinely. I think the poor 320i will end up roadkill vs even the base model G37.
It's not that BMW doesn't make good cars, it's that they did the same thing that Lexus did with the miserable IS250. It's so weak, bland, and uninspiring to drive compared to the bigger version that it really doesn't deserve to be in any category other than ""next""."

So who would pay BMW premium to get a 320i with lower horsepower? I am quoting from an article that I read online (http://www.bimmer-mag.com/issues/120/articles/practical-considerations?page=4#.U4odyagWeG0):
Beyond that entry-level buyer, here’s who should also consider the 320i: urban commuters seeking BMW handling, luxury, connectivity and panache, and those upon whom the harsh realization has dawned that they don’t need a rocket car to satisfy their daily driving needs. From stoplight-to-stoplight, it would be rather nice to use less gas, and it’s equally nice to spend less money. The 36-month lease payment is $50 less for the 320i than that for the 328i, and even though the latter is much quicker and potentially faster, you won’t miss that sitting in traffic. The two cars are virtually indistinguishable at light throttle under 40 mph. Why pay more?
That's me going from a BMW 335d to 320i. I save $200 per month on my lease and I am actually having more fun with the 320i. Maybe because its lighter, not sure, but it feels just more lively and the handling is so much more precise.
I could have gone with Focus ST or G37 and saved some more money (for some reason the GTI and A3 lease much higher due to really bad residuals), but decided to stay with BMW, since having had it before, I knew exactly what I was getting - a RWD sedan that handles great and is lot of fun to drive in around the city."
569,"May 31, 2014 6:02PM",sweendogy,"Don't mind the above response understandable wanting to save money, and get a rwd sedan & if you can due it with weather, but is this car a ELLPs under that configuration, no it's not - Lexus once sold a RWD is250 that could be had with a 6 speed - they sold it as a performance sedan- no one bought this configuration or cared- even caddy which is aiming big time at the bmw has a similar priced car and a base engine with similar weak power but neglected to give us the manual because it's not a real draw with the weaker engine-non-turbo, it's more of a pricing thing I guess. Real performance seekers would never opt for the 4 cyl 180 non turbo- it's bland. Also real lux seekers would never opt for a pleather, base stereo, no power seat car - doesn't add up- car is not Ellps. And at the bargain price of 35k really? And done"
570,"May 31, 2014 7:01PM",dino001,"Have you even driven it, Sweeny? How do you know it's so bad and weak? I have not driven it myself, perhaps my next service visit I get a chance, if dealer finally turns that 328 loaner inventory. I must say, I rather believe a guy who actually drove it and wrote that article that said this 320 reminded him the old 325 he actually owned (which has been basically a benchmark defining the category in its balanced design), rather than a guy who looks at some number tables and proclaims the thing not being worthy his time.
BTW, isn't it interesting that today's car having track time of 1988 M3 (just 26 years) can be seen as having a ""weak engine""? Sure, things evolved and expectations today are somewhat different then 20+ years ago, but perhaps we went a bit too far. It is true that the competition honestly caught up with BMW in lot of aspects of that category, a lot of that started in arms race in brochure values of the horsepower, or straight line accelaration numbers combined with adding nice stuff to it. It is a new reality. Over 200 horses, 3000 lbs, we still complain too little of thise or that. Consumer is the king. BMW themselves also evolved in direction that many think lost some original appeal. But I simply cannot take your argument that just because some numbers don't align with your idea what ELLPS should be, it doesn't belong. Until I actually sit inside and try it, I don't know."

bmw you hit it on the head they were part of the problem(?) by adding hp.

There's a harsh bit of reality in all of that, though. The type of driver who is all of that will be buying the car with automatic virtually 100% of the time.(barring some oddball statistical freak who you find to come here on this forum just to dispute this)
So no manual. But, wait... everyone says that to be ELLPS it has to have manual...
So are we talking ""offered with manual so that I can say it qualifies, despite that nobody buys this model with manual"" or ""It's not the real thing unless it has manual - let me show you the pictures""?
So... no manual, no power, no luxury, and 30K?
Tell me how this qualifies. All I get out of this equation is ELS... Entry level sedan. If we are to believe that article, the driver who is satisfied with that for their daily driving needs would probably be happy with anything if it had the right badge on it to impress their co-workers for a few seconds.

Manual or Automatic in your 320i?"

On the other hand, I have a hot hatch that puts over 300 bhp through the front wheels. It is also fun, but in an entirely different way.
Of course many of the ""experts"" in this topic would dismiss all three cars because-oh the horror!-none of them have full leather power seats.

578,"June 1, 2014 9:14AM",Mr_Shiftright,"Well then, the argument for the 320 has to be that a 328 is not worth an extra $50 a month. That seems a bit weak, no?"
579,"June 1, 2014 11:09AM",justg0,"I think its worth it for people looking for that extra hp. Its the same argument when going from 328 to 335. Is that extra hp worth the premium you pay? Only the person buying can decide that for themselves.
Another thing is that in reality the difference comes out to be more like $100 or more. The moment a dealer gets a car with Sport line or M Sport, they put some much other stuff that the car gets lot more expensive. I was hard pressed to find a 328i with just Sport line and nothing much more. So unless you are willing to custom order and wait, you would end up paying much more.
@plekto said:

I can bet 90% of people who buy the cars in the ELLPS category, whether BMW, Audi, Lexus, Mercedes, etc. get automatic (and also probably have never seen this forum). I haven't looked at any data on this, so if someone has anything to support or refute this, would appreciate that. I am just going on based on what I found on dealer lots when I was looking. So, in that case none of these cars would qualify to be a ELLPS, we might as well close this forum down
And yes, I did get an automatic, but that's my personal preference. BMW does make it available in manual like their other 3 series."
580,"June 1, 2014 11:20AM",m6user,"If this was a forum about ELPS one would expect no power seats, no leather, no sunroolf, no high tech in the dash, etc. But most buyers, when they are looking for a luxury car, expect those kinds of things. Hard core rally guys could probably care less as all they really care about is does it run and is it fun to drive. But when one positions the discussion to talk about entry level LUXURY PERFORMANCE sedans then at least a moderate level of luxury should be expected or we might as well include Mazda6s and Honda Accord V6 in the discussion. Luxury cars are not strictly delineated by the car but by the dealer, warranty, service etc that also comes with the purchase of luxury nameplate.
The reason why many on here were opposed to the TSX being included here was that it didn't seem to have the performance side nailed down. However, it did have the luxury side nailed down pretty well as most of the things recently mentioned came standard on it.
I think when you buy(and pay extra for) a luxury car from a luxury nameplate there should be somewhat of a basic standard which one can expect without having to option the vehicle up to the hilt just to reach the standard that most other luxury brands start off with. Some here almost come across as denigrating those that do like a little luxury with their auto by making statements like ""if it doesn't come with it I don't need it or if I don't need it to shift gears, what good is it"". Not direct quotes but silly just the same."

I have no idea if this is true but it might be if (as I have read) the 320 motor is basically a de-tuned version of the one in the 328. It's amazing what a little extra boost can do for a turbo four."

Not a good thing with over-boosted turbo.
The reason that BMW sets the boost level where it does is, of course, so that the car maintains that nice balance of reliability, nice manners and decent performance.

Dealer replaced coils, plugs, and fuel pump (this was the car's second fuel pump) across 3 different trips for the limp mode problem. Seemed OK for a little while again.
After 1 track event where the car was plagued by overheating, I added a custom larger oil cooler and downpipes (thought maybe deleting the cats from so close to the engine could help with heat). But then the vanos solenoid problems began. While on my 3rd set of those, the car started making some very disturbing but faint noises from down deep within, so I gave up, quickly removed the downpipes and tuner, and traded her in. Total ownership period was 18 months.
With the JB4 by itself, I think they were claiming 340-350 hp, IIRC. With the DPs, it should have been somewhere in the 370hp range. Some folks were pushing far more through the N54 engine, but I didn't feel the need for that much. It was damned quick, and a great deal of fun when running right.

Well I last posted on May 29. Whew! I think I am finally caught back up on the reading of the many -- mostly very good -- posts.
I have some take-aways that comes from speed-reading about 60 posts AFAP:
Talking with specificity about cars you haven't driven is like critiquing a movie after only seeing the trailers -- that's a good one, I will be swiping that with great enthusiasm and some frequency.
Going on and on about how a 5, 10, 15 year old or older car and proclaiming it is better than the current crop must've been said/written sarcastically or perhaps ironically. Not that everything new is better, but, well as a general rule things (like cars) have tended to be better along with the passage of time.
Stick shifts are great, ""no one"" buys them anymore because: see #2. Oh, somewhere I read that even in cars -- like the ELLPS's -- that actually do offer stick shifts, the take-up by actual paying customers continues to shrink and it is something less than 3% or perhaps 2%. Now that I have, in my garage, a 7-speed dual-clutch and an 8-speed tiptronic, I know the reason. If the best of breed 8-speed doesn't ""shift your opinion"" well today's 7-speed dual-clutch certainly will be virtually irresistible.
Some folks here will correctly note that they can option load-up a non-ellps car, note that it meets or beats the ""fill-in-the-blank"" ellps in content, performance and the big one, price and apparently end with an implied ""so how 'bout them apples"" or ""so there!""
Continuing:
In my experience ""people need those stinkin' badges!""
To make a, or perhaps ""the"" point: My MontBlanc pen uses a 3 or 4-dollar refill, the same one used in some other really ""way less expensive"" (I'll say) pens. In the same spirit, my Tag watch doesn't tell time any better than my $750 Swiss Army Watch I got at Macy's. That's not the point -- well, OK, it may be ONE point, but it's the overall ""certain something"" that makes luxury goods, well, hmm, ""worth more."" Once I get over ""needing"" a white and blue roundel or four interlocking rings, etc, well, I'll get a KIA of some sort.
I like coming back after a few days to see how we've advanced the discussion here.
I'm really gonna try to test drive more cars, 'cause y'all are BRUTAL!
DILYL"
627,"June 4, 2014 5:10PM",sweendogy,"The value of a money I guess means different things to different people. Acura at one time was a superior value to other lux cars and offered performance- still does-- now the mainstream cars, many of which use the same components as lux siblings cost thousands less and similar performance but I guess should not be compared because of a badge. 750 Macy watch sounds good to me, my timex just broke."
628,"June 4, 2014 6:35PM",markcincinnati,"I do like, very much, my Victorinox Swiss Army watch -- I think it, in some ways, looks nicer than the Tag. But, the thing is, the Victorinox is not a ""luxury"" watch. A new Malibu LTZ (a very attractive looking car), is also not an Infiniti, Lexus, BMW, Audi, Mercedes -- it even doesn't fit in the same class as the Volvo S60.
We're here -- well some of us are -- in ELLPS land perhaps because we ""choose"" not to buy/lease an LPS automobile. Perhaps some of us -- as Alfred Sloan imagined -- would start with a Chevy and aspire to a Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick and ultimately a Cadillac. I suspect Sloan is the father of the term ""aspirational"" as it applied to cars.
We're here, I'll bet, because we either aspire to an ELLPS, have an ELLPS and aspire to an LPS or are just car-nuts who know the good stuff comes from Audi, BMW, Infiniti, etc.
I was wondering today when the last time I saw a Phaeton was -- years ago is all I could come up with. Saw several A8's today, however. I test drove a Phaeton (way back when) which was seriously discounted and sub-vented (and as a reminder I owned an A8) thinking I could get a ""new A8"" for a fraction of the cost by going with the Phaeton. The Phaeton was, closed eyes, an A8. Same sweeeet 4.2L V8, quattro (well, you know) etc. I just couldn't bring myself to pull the trigger -- probably the biggest bargain I'll ever see. Damn HUGE-[non-permissible content removed] ""VW"" emblem on the thing.
Instead of the bargain it probably was, I knew I would be thinking, ""I paid THIS MUCH for a VW?!? What was I thinking?""
You know I still think if you can't or won't go with an S4, the next best thing is the Acura TL SH-AWD Advance (and I assume the TLX is even better). Even my non-car loving friends called my TL ""a Honda."" Slamming the tinny doors was just enough of a confirmation of that notion to remind me that the Acura brand had slipped from Premium status.
My wife collects pens -- I have perhaps four or five (that were gifts from her) -- I probably would not go out and buy a new 4-figure MontBlanc, but I do notice when I see Brian Williams use one on the air. My MontBlancs (3 of them) are all the pens I need (one of them broke and I had to send it to Germany to get it fixed -- seems as good as new). My wife must get 6 new pens per year. I sort of get it. Until her current car (the SQ5 Prestige), she liked cars, but wasn't really ""passionate"" about them.
Get this, for about 15 minutes she actually considered a Subaru -- which was pretty nice, but kind of trucky and not at all luxurious or even terribly sporty. I knew she would love the price and by the time she needed her second tank of gas would be ""praying for the end of time"" (Meat Loaf).
Now, however, she is ""into cars"" and is unlikely to aspire to anything other than an Audi or a BMW -- I can't see reverse aspiration being a viable option (for her or for most people, in fact).
Anyway, this collection of ELLPS cars is perhaps the most exciting and ""strokable"" lot in all of cardom. It is here that we see innovation (often before the LPS offerings, even from the same brand), performance and often a huge leap up from even the top of the next lower line.
Remember the Phaeton, long live the Phaeton.
You know how to drive it . . . ."
629,"June 4, 2014 7:20PM",m6user,"In other words......you get what you pay for. On paper a decked out Hyundai Sonata Turbo has the power, leather, panoramic moonroof, fancy bells and whistles that most of these ellps have but every switch, piece of leather. undercarriage part, latch, hinge, carpet etc etc is cheap compared to these cars. Other mainstream brands may be a little better but still don't approach the luxury brands. The dealer experience is not the same either. I had an Infiniti and have an Acura but have had tons of non-luxury brands and the dealer experience is much different. Yes, you pay for it but that is my point."
630,"June 4, 2014 7:35PM",sweendogy,"Funny you mention the phaeton - what's the view on the genesis (k900)- or was the vw to early to this party- or better yet was the vw to costly to begain with-or does the Kia not work because of the badge. vw started at 60 and went to 100k -had issues with reliability and was not marketed well, but as mentioned here as they might redo it for sale. - so maybe not totally forgotten.

634,"June 5, 2014 11:37AM",markcincinnati,"Sween,
Small correction, I used the term ""strokable"" in my post, I'm not sure how it got translated to ""stokable"" -- I meant, by strokable, cars that are as described in the next post by 'm6user' who continued and gave an additional example of the point. Also it was a rip-off of a Wayne's World throwaway line by Mike Meyers.
Also, yes, these are entry-level LPS cars and they can be less expensive than the next step up. However, many if not all of these ellps cars can be easily optioned to numbers beginning with a 5 or a 6. So while it is true that ellps customers -- and want to be customers -- may be somewhat budget minded (since they're not shopping further up the MSRP scale, apparently) folks that shop and buy these vehicles are looking for ""better"" and/or ""more"" and/or a pretty hefty step up in luxury features and perceived quality of materials.
OK, the forum is about cars, not other luxury goods -- perhaps the analogies and some poorly written or expressed sarcasm or irony are misplaced. In response to the shopper who configures a Ford Taurus SHO and then remarks the ""fill in the blank"" ellps or lps isn't worth the extra $X-thousands, I had hoped the point would be punctuated by examples in other areas, e.g., outdoor grills, pens and watches. Some folks only buy Rolex's (not me, FWIW) and some see not one bit of extra value in a Rolex when they can have a far less expensive timepiece, etc, etc. Some folks wouldn't pay $1,000 more for an upgraded audio system in their new Mercedes C -- but might spring for the MontBlanc.
If someone wants to ""prove"" than a Subaru WRX is the equivalent of or superior to a BMW 335 X-drive, by configuring both ""similarly"" and then citing some performance stats, well have at it. The WRX, for all I know, may actually out-accelerate the Bimmer and so on -- but that doesn't make the Subie an ellps or lps by any stretch.
Anyway, if the grills, pens and watches analogies don't track, I'll endeavor to minimize such transgressions.
I do not, however know what ""enuf of the better then now stuff"" means. These cars, I think we all mostly agree, are better ""now"" than ""then."" I guess several of the reviews of the Q50 have suggested that it did not improve upon the G37 -- which may be what you were referring to.
We may all have our definitions of ellps or even luxury for that matter, which is why I say, most of the time, ""Drive it like you live. . . ."""
635,"June 5, 2014 2:16PM",laurasdada,"We appear to be a verbose, well-educated, fair and friendly bunch. I enjoy this topic, and topics in a similar vein.

Heck, Autoweek regularly writes articles about watches for drivers and regarding auto affiliations.
Just my humble opinion, but these forums should be fun and informative. Marktheredsbengal's posts generally are just that.

I've been reading his posts for well over a decade and generally find them enjoyable and/or useful.

637,"June 5, 2014 4:48PM",sweendogy,"Marks comments stand on own, you can love them or question them- I generally love his posts and they usually add something. He's long at times and trys hard to explain things in verbose commentary which is his style. The ego driven explanation on LUx is nothing but rude, well educated in writting sure but let's be real- no one needs to know about the 4 1k pens one ones .maybe he was ""stroking"" his ego.- I understand people here are drawn to badges, I'm a city person who grew up in a modest environment and we are on an ELlps forum- this is not a BEntley forum- the category started with value oriented lux performance cars, entry level. From post One on this board I have always stressed the dollar as being a major factor when comparing cars, research and overall drive as well. That's why I don't understand the puppet mentality of some who just follow the badge."
638,"June 5, 2014 5:17PM",markcincinnati,"I would suggest, perhaps even argue, the dollar becomes progressively less of a major factor when we move into any incarnation of the Premium or Luxury class (especially where cars are concerned). Folks -- generally speaking -- don't shop for ellps or lps cars with much consideration for budget (however, even when buying an ellps, I assume we all stipulate $X dollars for the purchase -- of our new 3 series or new IS 350, etc). I would hope we all want to get the most we can for our dollar, and I assume we do. If, however, you want to spend less, it is quite possible to move down a rung and get, for instance, a Chrysler 300 -- and there is NOTHING wrong with that.
The reason the Escalade (for example) exists is because there are folks who are very happy to pay for the Caddy over the lesser GM offerings that lack the Wreath and Crest. Of course there are substantive differences (between the Cadillac and the GMC for instance), but if you read the profits story you know the margins ARE much higher the more you climb the lux/premium/ellps/lps ladder.
Perhaps the luxury goods represent a lesser ""value"" since they have higher profit margins -- but I'll wager if fill in the blank produces yet another vehicle with breathtakingly expensive MSRP's there will probably be no shortage of takers. Who would have thought an X6 would have a market -- well, not me. And, much as I love Audis, I test drove -- back to back -- an A6 and an A7 and until I opened the glove box and found the stack of bills, I kept hunting for the $10,000 premium the A7 commanded.
They can't keep the A7's in stock. If you had any concern about price for content, there would be far fewer A7 sales ""if you axe me!""
I have a few ""expensive"" pens (gifts from my wife, to repeat), I ""appreciate"" them, but would not buy them for myself. Like laurasdada, I see the ""value"" of the Omega or the IWC or the Tag, I also appreciate the Invicta and the Swiss Army -- in sum this particular forum is less about ""budget"" or ""value"" or ""MSRP"" than it is about folks who ""aspire"" to ""the next step up the ladder.""
Of course, I am often wrong, but seldom uncertain.
To anyone who interprets anything I say as being rude either in intention or execution, I apologize. Like I said, you guys (not gender defining) are brutal."
639,"June 5, 2014 5:41PM",flightnurse,"Mark's writing reminds me of a friend, when he told a story he took the long way to get to the point, which I kind of like."
640,"June 6, 2014 5:32AM",dino001,"In other, words people buy what they want. They don't care if other people don't think that ""it"" is worth the price. Conversely, other people cannot even comprehend why somebody would buy something like filltheblank because there is another filltheblank just as good (in their eyes, anyway) and cheaper. And it's all good.
There is another type of discussion we have here constantly - does filltheblank belong to ELLPS? Honestly, I don't really understand why people get so worked up if it does, or does not. Many people would cross shop cars that are not the same ""category"", so what... The line will always be blurred and they move. Yesterday's luxury is today's standard. Yesterday's benchmark of sportiness (like manual transmission) is becoming so rare that it's impossible to use as an actual measuring stick. Prices go up incessantly, so yesterday's 30K car is today's 40K. And so on. If somebody cross shops Ford Focus ST or Subaru WRX/STI with BMW 328i and somebody else cross-shops Lexus ES (not even IS) with same BMW, who am I to say they are ""wrong"" about looking at them? They'll choose what they like at the end, it may not be ELLPS, but who cares.
I say something much more revolutionary - ELLPS is dead, there is no ELLPS. There is bunch of former ELLPS, but they got so diverse that it's too wide. Some lost ""Entry Level"" pricing (long time ago, I might say), others lost performance, others went beyond ""Entry Level"" luxury. Then bunch of outsiders got to the 0-60 and horsepower game, keeping to horses on front wheels, but hey, it's still 250+ horses. There is also a small breed of AWD (some are FWD) bandits that are ""too small"" or don't have enough ""stuff"", but 30 years ago ""real"" ELLPS were just their size, had lesser 0-60, slalom time, crank windows, cloth seats and nobody was ranting they were no ELLPS. Just saying..."
641,"June 6, 2014 10:05AM",flightnurse,"Mid last year on a flight from Detriot to Miami my seatmate struck up a conversation with me regarding cars (I have all of the car mag's on my iPad.) His questions were odd, but focused. He asked what kind of car I had, when I told him none at moment, asked why, and if I'm in the market for a car. After about 20 minutes I asked him what he did. Come to find out he works for Intellishop, then we started talking about mystery shoppers and such. He asked if I would be interested in being a mystery shopper, but declined, but knew someone who would, Rick. We talk about him and my seatmate was happy. So for the past year Rick been a mystery shopper for Intellishop, this is where the testing of cars come from. It's been interesting so far the Kia K900 and E350 have been standouts, maybe not in the way you think.
K900 is a home run, but the biggest issue is getting people who can afford a $66K car to come into the dealer or think about Kia.
E350, the saleman was the worst but the car he showed us was absolutely stunning, the color combo worked on the car. That is the only positive thing Rick said about the whole MB experience. We weren't even offered a test drive, and haven't driven a E class in several years I was looking forward to it.
In regards to cross shopping, the Kia dealer ask this when we looked at the Cadzena and K900, no other dealer ask this question.
The interesting thing about Intellishop is you have a ""script"" already going into the dealership, and a certain car to look at. At the MB dealer, we had to look at the E350 ""gas"" so the new E350 Bluetec was out of the question, but really want to test drive this car...
This whole debate on what is and isn't a ELLPS is really a subjective thing, just like in the medical word, pain is a subjective. I had patients who would complain of the worse pain of their life, but couldn't keep theirs eyes open because of the heavy doses of pain medications they were on...
I'm with Dino, the ELLPS is dead, since one can buy a $27K hatchback that does 0-60 in the same time as a car that cost twice as much from the homeland."

it's like buying watches do you need the Tag if you have 3k when you can get a macys watch for 750 (with coupons less) and that said watch for 750 actually looks and performs better then a 3k tag? They both have the same warrantee - sure the dealer experience could be better at the tag dealer - but most people would rather not spend time at a dealer, unless they are getting paid."
645,"June 6, 2014 6:02PM",flightnurse,"The K900 is NOT a sports sedan lets get that out first. The K900 (which I really hate the name) was impressive, the 5 liter V8 has plenty of power and has a nice rumble to it, but nothing too loud, just enough to let you know it's there. The 8 spd transmission is the same unit in BMW (but of course gearing and software differences) shifts very smoothly and never had a problem with that. The Kia dealer came to our house with it (this was part of the scrpit from Intillishop) and the salesman (specially trained to sell K900s) was very good explaining the car to us, and he used certain ""key phrases"" when pointing features of the car. So just driving around town, the V8 is right in the smack of it's torque band. Merging onto the freeway the K900 moves well, but not as well as one would think with 420hp. The K900 is not a rocket ship, it can move if needed. Head room, leg room, hip room is bigger then a 5 series, it's more inline with a 7 series, but with a mid level 5 series price tag. The Nappa leather was supple, soft and felt very rich. Fit and Finish was first rate, everything was though of and placed perfectly. IF you are looking for a luxury car not much of a sports sedan then the K900 would be well worth the look. As I stated it is a home run, but not a grand slam...."

Now Luxury is subjective, is the 320i as luxurious as say Ricks Genesis, NO. Is the 320i a luxury sedan compared to a Kia Forte, Yes.
If someone goes from a Mid-level Atlima SV to a 320i they might say the 320i is more luxurious. I don't think you will ever see BMW ever advertise the 320i as a luxury sedan, even with Premium Package, Nav, Xenon lights, I would call it a Entry Level Luxury sedan.

Kia will have a hard time getting people who own BMW's, Audi's, Lexus and MB to come into their dealership to look at the K900, the perception would be, the K900 isn't to the level of the Germans, but if one looks deep enough they will find out that they are. it would hard for a MB owner to see themselves driving a Kia.
I think Kia and Hyundia have a big uphill battle to deal with, it might have been for them to take a play out of Honda, Toyota and Nissan and make a luxury Brand outside of Kia and Hyundia. Mazda was going to have Amati as their luxury brand and didn't go through with it, I think this is why you wont see a 50-60K Mazda, Getting people to spend that kind of money for Mazada will be tough, very tough."

I don't think any amount of marketing can change that perception, when you can see cheap Kia cars at the dealership or on the roads.

654,"June 8, 2014 1:33AM",justg0,"For some of the top companies in the world, their brand is basically the most important thing. For e.g., when a consumer buys an Apple product, they expect a certain level of quality and attention to detail, which you will not find in other company products. Take for e.g. Samsung, their main competitor in the cell phone area - even though a Samsung phone may have more features and may seem like a better value for money to lot of people, it just cannot compete with Apple in terms of quality and attention to detail. Samsung uses cheap plastic to make their phones. Apple will never do that. The engineers at Apple spend so much time on each small tine little thing, that when you hold their finished product, you can just feel how good it is.
Same holds true for cars, Lexus represents a certain brand, so does Audi and BMW. What brand does Hundai or Kia represent? Even though they may have more features than BMW or Lexus, they just feel cheap, because at their core they are a value brand. And there is no way a Sonata can match BMW in terms of handling or transmission or any of the stuff that makes a car fun to drive. If you care all about HP, then sure there are tons of other cars with that can beat a BMW with similar or lower price tags.
You can't avoid the dealership - you need to go their to buy the car and for regular maintenance. I lease my cars, so I am there at least once every 3 years, plus a few times in between. And you can feel the difference between a luxury car dealership vs. a value brand. I totally understand that I am ultimately paying for that experience and I am fine with it.

664,"June 9, 2014 12:32PM",markcincinnati,"The ELLPS Category is More Alive Now Than at Any Other Time in History (Part 1)
I’m going to take exception to the suggestion that “ELLPS” as a category is “dead” – indeed, I think it is a very much alive and healthy category/segment; it is almost certainly growing and definitely aspirational category. Both consumers and manufacturers aspire – and often ardently aspire – in their own way to this category in fact.
“ELLPS's are like porn, I can’t define them, but I know them when I see them. . .”
We can’t go on unless some stipulations are made, and these stipulations are possibly made up of nearly equal parts of fact and opinion (I would agree if you said opinion is weighed more heavily should you be so inclined to make that argument). ELLPS autos are difficult to define – perhaps the [unintentionally ironic, I’m sure] quote above, a derivative of Justice Potter Stewart’s famous remark, “I know it [obscenity] when I see it, and the motion picture involved in this case is not that,"" captures the essence of the problem of figuring out what is and what is not an ELLPS.
I think I’ll just go with something like: An ELLPS is an automobile with more basic or “included” content or other “stuff”, one that is generally thought to be of higher quality (another “I know it when I see it” attribute, to be sure) with more “available” comfort/convenience/performance features and amenities, higher style/design attributes (ditto) and noticeably more precise fit and finish (tighter tolerances) than other vehicles that the ELLPS candidate can be measured up against. The dealership experience also bears noting too, as it is, or should be, a cut above, too.
The ELLPS is kind of an anomaly (or at least it was), since its creators want us to know it offers both luxury and performance, traits that used to be almost mutually exclusive. Perhaps an ELLPS candidate or incumbent is (or should be) like the tire type we call “Grand Touring”. But, then, even that metaphor falls short these days, as it certainly appears that one of the prices (pun intended) for entry into the 2014 ELLPS class is “higher performance numbers” than even a few short years ago in the 21st century. Maybe, today (for American consumers), the more correct tire metaphor for an ELLPS is “Ultra High-performance All-season”. Of course, we need be mindful of the “S” in ELLPS, which, of course stands for sedan (and I’ll put a stake in the ground that this means 4-doors, despite whatever model names some manufacturer comes up with – thinking of the name “4-door coupé” for instance).
Perhaps some attempt to say what is not an ELLPS would be helpful (as would a level setting question or two): A Bentley (any Bentley) is not an ELLPS (I would argue it is not an LPS either), nor is any Porsche (even a Panamera falls outside of even the most liberal definitions of both ELLPS and LPS, if you axe me) or a Hyundai. But does this exclude the somewhat stand-alone models named Genesis and Equus?
I think both the Genesis and Equus fall short on their “P” quotients, making them ineligible for either ELLPS or LPS inclusion, but maybe that’s just me and possibly this is a temporary situation – see the latest Car & Driver review of the Genesis sedan now with “suspension tuning by Lotus”).
Buicks don’t count either, right? But wait, what about the Regal GS with AWD and a few option boxes checked off – such as most all of the electronic safety nannies so popular with the presumptively bona fide ELLPS members from Germany, Japan (and Sweden)? Does said Regal GS merit an invitation into the hallowed ELLPS category or is it yet too soon to bestow this lofty ~yet perhaps increasingly dubious~ honor?"
665,"June 9, 2014 12:32PM",rbirns1,"Watches and cars are not a good analogy. A car is for transportation, but has many facets (comfort, performance, features, etc.) that vary greatly from one to another. A watch has just one function, and all watches pretty much handle that function the same. Other that that it's all for show, literally just a piece of jewelry."
666,"June 9, 2014 12:34PM",markcincinnati,"The ELLPS Category is More Alive Now Than at Any Other Time in History (Part 2)
Can any sedan, regardless of pedigree, be inducted (or indicted) into the ELLPS hall of fame if it cannot be had with either RWD or AWD (FWD only cars need not apply); likewise can any sedan that is primarily, obviously and overwhelmingly badge engineered apply for ELLPS or LPS club membership (thinking of the current Lincoln MKZ which screams badge engineered Ford Fusion here)?
Hopefully, too, we can stipulate that to be in the ELLPS, even with all of the MSRP bracket-creep we’ve seen these past few years, that there is a “size component” we should probably consider. For example, even though today’s BMW 3 is pretty darn close in size to yesterday’s 5, we will accept a 3 series (no matter how pricey) as a member of the ELLPS clan in good standing, but we won’t admit any 5 series (even if it is configured to be less expensive – with a 4-cylinder turbo, and option stripped – than a 3 series) because the 5 series is simply too big (at least at this instant in history; and, let’s agree this could change as the 2’s, 3’s and 5’s morph into god knows what next).
And for pity’s sake are we going to point to something like the new A3 – which is exactly the same size as an earlier gen A4 – and say, “Nope, you’re not ELLPS, you’re a Premium car.” Personally, I’d exclude the A3 from the club, perhaps calling it an Entry-level ELLPS instead. But, that would be just plain silly.
Yet, for discussion purposes, I’m not sure I want to be engaging in conversations with those who aren’t interested in, ahem, “The right kind, or our kind” [of car] – you know, allowing them in here just might make the conversations even messier and perhaps occasionally, er, ""from time-to-time"", even more pugnacious and xenophobic than they are already (if that’s even possible).
So we’re left with [my] belief [and maybe yours too] that the American automobile consumer is faced with a segmented market (one that is growing more so all the time). Perhaps there are divergent opinions on this that follows: Virtually every car manufacturer on the planet wants to have cars that are in the ELLPS and LPS class – and granted ELLPS can mean different things for folks in Beijing and Buffalo. The reason for this LPS-Lust is simple: Premium compacts (like the new A3), ELLPS’s (like the Lexus IS 350 F-Sport) and LPS’s like the Mercedes E-class, etc. are where the profit margins soar. No wonder Hyundai (and KIA) are, with each successive generation, pushing hard, harder, hardest to be members of the Acura (for now), Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Infiniti, Lexus, Mercedes and possibly Volvo Club.
Why? So they can raise prices, natch.
Remember the Lexus playbook (bring in a car -- and give it a ""number"", not a name: LS400 -- that apparently has 100% of the Mercedes content down-pat and sell it at 75-80% of the price of the Merc)? The only thing that might be the “yes but” for the Korean’s is that they’re trying to become ELLPS and LPS club members without separate, purpose-built dealerships – this admittedly cost and time saving approach may ultimately not sit well with the ELLPS and LPS cognoscente or even the general car consuming hoi polloi; yet, the only person I know who has an Equus says the dealership experience has been superlative.
For now, we need not – here – concern ourselves with discussions or comparisons to the really high-end cars (like the Bentley mentioned above or other super-luxury brands from foreign lands). At this point in time, we’ve got some really interesting cars to discuss and an upcoming pipeline that is exemplified by Car & Driver’s recent article “25 Cars Worth Waiting For”.
The ELLPS category is more alive now than at any other time in history. At least that’s the way I see it.
Often wrong, never uncertain, I remain."
667,"June 9, 2014 12:47PM",stickguy,"Mark, I disagree about the blanket exclusion of FWD.
And I guess it is clear you require brand snobbery as part of the criteria, as opposed to being based on purely function."
668,"June 9, 2014 1:37PM",markcincinnati,"I think disagreement regarding FWD is a good thing. I have had many -- or at least ""several"" FWD cars from US and German mfgrs over the years and I found them worthy of many things, perhaps even inclusion into the ELLPS and LPS rank and file.
Funny, sort of, it used to be that 4-cylinder motivated cars need not apply. Well, my my my how things have changed. I'd be (I've been) proud and pleased to have a 4-cylinder BMW or Audi and probably I'd be fine with an ATS with a 4-cylinder motivator too.
Right now, today, at this instant, however, I believe FWD vehicles need not apply -- regardless of how you and I may feel and think about the subject. I think the bias, right now, against FWD is so strong it may be ""stronger than dirt""! Evidence the Genesis ""brand"" -- Genesis eschewed anything but RWD for the first generation, now with the new ones, they're offering up both RWD and AWD in the 6-cylinder version and promised AWD in the 8 ""soon"". FWD, currently and based on much that I read here and by the pros is like an embarrassing tattoo you got one night when you were ""not quite right"" for some reason. You're working on getting rid of it ASAP, but these things take time.
On the other hand, who knows, the benefits (and there are many) of FWD may win out after all. Just remember that FWD was initially put in cars to make them cheaper (to make and buy). There is, for some, a stigma associated with ""FWD"" cars that aspire to be in the Premium, ELLPS, LPS, High-end luxury or Super luxury class. Same holds true for sports cars, super cars and exotics -- they are (or must be to not be posers) RWD or AWD. Mercedes did bring out the CLA as FWD, to be sure -- and there is some risk there (but it can be had with AWD); the A3 is also FWD (like most Audi models) and offers up AWD. At this point ALL incoming inventory for the A3's (here in Cincinnati) will be quattros. That may change.
The ATS and CTS were rendered from the get-go as RWD (with AWD available) because that is what is (NOW, today) expected.
Luxury may or may not = ""Snobbery"". We're talking, here, on this forum, about some variation of a type that contains the words: Luxury, Performance, Sedan -- entry level or not. Luxury is beyond (above? beside? below? -- pick one) being based on ""pure function"", I think is safe to say.
Luxury means to most of us, I assume, ""stuff"", features, amenities, capabilities, levels of refinement beyond what is ""basic"", beyond what is strictly necessary. If you think this equates to brand snobbery, even if I conceded (personally) your point, even if I 100% agreed with you, this is the place where ""we"" are going to discuss, debate, and perhaps even politely argue about luxury cars (that happen to also be capable of a decent amount of ""high"" performance).
So yes, brand snobbery is ""a"" criteria for this discussion, just not necessarily ""my"" criteria to be a member of ""the club"". However, I can somewhat sense saying ""If the shoe fits"" isn't an inappropriate thought.
I saw a very long and impressive video about the Chrysler 300C when it first came out -- and the Chrysler engineers involved in rendering this fine car kept comparing it to an Audi A8.
I love the 300C, especially the ones with the refreshed interiors and AWD, but Senator, ""I've known A8's and you ain't no Audi A8.""
The point is, we -- here -- are but PART of the market -- and we may disagree with the overall market's standards and definitions (and they keep changing all of the time) -- but we need to recognize, I think, the prevailing trends, ideas and standard-bearers. I'm operating under the assumption that this ELLPS forum is one of the places to be able to discuss certain brands and not have to apologize that they aren't in a more hoi polloi category in a manner of speaking."

On the other hand I violently agree with your right to your opinion and your right (unless someone here at Edmund's objects) to say it long and loud.
I believe the ""data"" and ""professional opinion"" supporting your conclusions about watches, however, would be difficult, perhaps nearly impossible to come by.
I do believe the same data-deprived statement could actually be made about cars, too -- please note I am NOT being serious here, just ironic or perhaps sarcastic (sometimes difficult to carry off in one of these postings without it inadvertently coming off as a personal criticism, which it is not meant to be):
""A car has just one function, and all cars pretty much handle that function the same.""
I sincerely hope no one here thinks that would even remotely be true.
But I do believe there is plenty of data and opinion to support the notion that [luxury] watches and cars (and even pens, damnit) have many attributes, not just a single one.
The metaphor suggested -- or was meant to suggest -- attributes or characteristics that would help provide ""color commentary"" about luxury or premium products, the marketing of said products and the market for same.
Like I said, about myself, ""I'm often wrong, just never (or seldom) uncertain.""

The acura TLX is one that I've been waiting for, but have recently had some concerns. Although not a scientific sample, I've spoken to 8 people who own the TL (2007 - 2012), TSX (2010 - 2014) and MDX (2014). I had read a lot of people complaining about one issue with their acuras and it seems they have the same problem as the accord - wind noise (that is one of the reasons I bought a Toyota in 2010 instead of another accord - wind noise). Every one of the people I spoke to said they had wind noise from the windows. Is this a fluke or is this representative of what I can expect if I buy an acura?"

690,"June 12, 2014 6:54PM",wayne21,"Thank you, sweendogy. I had seen those sights before when googling wind noise and acura. My wife doesn't want another Toyota (we have a 6 cyl venza) or Honda (had an accord). I had a 2000 accord and it had tons of wind noise. In 2005, I looked at an accord (knowing about wind noise) and the wind noise was very obvious to me on each one we test drove so we bought a ford. In 2010, I test drove a couple accords and could hear wind noise on the test drives (ez to do when you actively listen for it) so we bought a Toyota. I have test driven and ridden in a few new accords (close friend has a 2014) and can hear the wind noise (my friend hears nothing). Wife doesn't want another ""car that everyone else has"" so I thought we'd step up. I know a number of people with acuras and when I ask them about wind noise they all say yes it is noticeable, but tolerable. I'm not interested in hearing wind noise. I'd think Honda could figure out how to build cars without wind noise.
Cars I'm considering - Acura TLX (agree on the first year model thing, but thought it to be a worth a look - just the wind noise issue associated with acuras/hondas), Infinit Q50 (don't care for the option packages I have to buy to get what I want), and the pending 2015 maxima (a significant update that I don't know much about, but my wife likes the looks of the car). I might even consider a Hyundai genesis sedan. The venza runs great and we're not in a hurry, but if the right ""upscale"" car comes along I'd buy it. (Car buying is a ""two vote"" for us - with no pressure to sway a vote so I think I'll wait to at least look at a maxima before buying, but I'm not sure when they're coming out - I think Sept."

I think this is something that is very subjective though. I have a new style RDX, and notice no wind noise. I also never noticed any on my 2005 Odyssey, 2005 Accord, or 2000 TL (still have that one).
about the only noise is tire noise on certain surfaces, but I never considered that objectionable even on bad pavement.

696,"June 15, 2014 8:28AM",roblaw,"The Genesis is a very quiet car and the 2015 Genesis is probably quieter still. But you have to know what you want. The TLX is likely to be sportier than a Genesis. The new Genesis is a full on luxury car with a premium interior and wonderful seats. It handles well but I will bet the TLX will be tidier, if for no other reason than it is will smaller and Honda has a good rep for tidy handling cars. The Genesis It is going to weigh probably 400+ lbs. more than a TLX is you compare the 3.5 TLX to a 3.8 Genesis. It is probably almost a foot longer. I will bet the TLX will handle better, be faster, be pretty quiet and get much better fuel economy (and front wheel drive will be better in bad weather as compared to the RWD Genesis unless you purchase the AWD model which will cost more and have even worse mileage).
It really depends on what you want and what you are willing to spend. Also, as great a car as the new Genesis is, its resale will probably be lower than the TLX because of the perception of Hyundais and the price (probably comparable to the TLX when comparably equipped). This will affect the overall cost of the vehicle whether you buy and hold or lease and dump.
So drive a lot of cars and try to ignore preconceived notions, as hard as that is. I think Acura/Honda is coming back from its worst years and probably still makes excellent cars. Hyundai also makes fine cars today (remember the 1986 Excel?). There is an amazing array of great cars in the TLX/Genesis price range that meet a wide variety of needs.
Good luck with your purchase."

701,"June 20, 2014 3:25PM",wayne21,"I plan to wait until the 2015s are out (TLX and Maxima) to seriously car shop, but I was out of town today and stopped by an infiniti and an acura dealership to just check out their cars. Not to test drive them, but was interested in the ease of entry/exit (a very important issue for the wife) and the interior appearance. Infiniti Q50 - nice that the passenger seat elevates! I think wife may be able to get in/out without any difficulty. It was a base model and I thought the interior was fine in spite of the vinyl (I would pay the extra for leather). It's been awhile since I looked at an Altima, but I don't think the Q50s interior was any nicer (maybe not even as nice) than the top of the line Altima. I also didn't understand why there was a spare tire taking up such a large portion of a small trunk in a car that has run-flat tires. But I realize the idea behind the Q50 isn't a ""nice interior"". I had read a number of sites that talked about an odor in the Q50 when left in the heat. I looked at one on the showroom floor (not in the heat) and didn't detect anything. It's a car I could own.
Then to the acura dealer just for a look. Looked at the TL with tech package on the floor. I was not impressed. I hope the TLX has a nicer interior. I thought the leather surfaces were nice, but I thought the materials used elsewhere on the interior were pretty cheap - a lot of hard plastic! The passenger seat elevated which was nice to see, but it seemed that in elevating the passenger seat it would be a bit harder to get in and out (harder than the Q50). I think it was the layout of the dash that forced me to move the seat all the way back to get it in that may make it hard for my wife to get in/out. Will wait until seriously shopping and have the wife try it out in the TLX. I am no fan of dealerships adding things to the car and this particular dealership adds about $3,000 to each sticker. I may be off by the individual numbers, but it was $500 for theft marking (if someone steals my car I don't want it back!), $700 to wax the car and spray the interior with scotch guard (I prefer turtle wax ice sealant and my own scotch guard - about $15 for both - and unlike the high school kid working for them that doesn't care about my car, I will do a good job and not miss anything), $750 for wheel locks, mud guards and a rubber mat in the trunk (a mat I wouldn't want in my car) and some other overpriced stuff I wouldn't be interested in and wouldn't pay for. I would pass on the car before paying for any of those things.
If I had to choose between the two, it was a no-brainer. It would be the Q50. I don't think I would even be interested in the TL. But once the TLX and maxima are out I'll seriously shop. Just one person's opinion... the guy that's going to pay for it. Not trying to step on anyone's toes or insult anyone. My wife is most interested in something that not everyone has. We bought a Toyota venza in 2010 and that was one of the reasons for purchasing it (as well as incredibly easy entry/exit for her). The people two doors down from us bought the same green venza. At church, we have 4 green venzas and 1 white venza (ours and the white one are the only 6 cylinders) and 3 of the green venzas (1 of which is ours) park side by side at the church (handicap parking)!"
702,"June 21, 2014 7:50PM",sweendogy,"Wayne21- the dealer add on to sticker in my experience has been on newer well wanted cars- I would doubt the acura dealer would purposely add massive fluff to an acura TL, and if they did you could call bluff pretty easy because fact is acura is not selling many TLs. Good luck with the search, church and Vensa."
703,"June 26, 2014 1:58PM",markcincinnati,"wayne21: I very much enjoyed most of the experience of owning an 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance. I had added the rear parking sensors and the ""factory"" splash guards to the car and I, to this day, call my TL, my ""Honda S4"" or my ""Acura S4"" -- the car must've come with 3-bent wheels, which may be the reason I thought the brake rotors were warped and had them turned three times (all under warranty).
Once the wheels were replaced (with a 50% credit from Acura), the car was smooth and the brakes didn't chatter or feel warped in any way.
I got the idea to call the TL my ""Acura S4"" not from an original thought, but from an Automobile test report where the S4 and the TL were compared even though the report observed most folks would probably NOT cross shop the two cars (they were some $11,000 apart, too -- the Audi was more expensive, of course).
I got tired of the Acura feeling about 90% of what I had hoped it would be -- which is actually a compliment considering I was comparing it to a car that was about 25% more money.
In any case, my Audi dealer (who is also an Acura dealer, go figure) made me a deal I couldn't refuse once he found out I had ordered a new Lexus IS350AWD F-Sport. Bought out the Acura lease (less than a year to go as I recall) and gave me a discount of 6% off the sticker of a new S4 configured exactly as I wanted it.
At the same time, my wife's Infiniti (2011 FX) was also coming off a 39 month lease and, yes, you guessed it, the Audi dealer (also an Acura dealer) is also an Infiniti dealer and once they got wind of my wife's tap dancing with a new BMW X3, made her an offer on a new Audi SQ5, that she couldn't refuse.
During our shopping adventure, we test drove the daylights out of all the usual (and some unusual) suspects.
I oh so wanted the Q50S/AWD to be the ""it"" car for the 2014 MY. It was good, maybe almost very good -- but for the money that I had to pay for the 2014 S4 I ended up with, I couldn't do it. BTW, probably not gonna make any friends, but I think I'd rather have the Q50/S than the 3 serires BMW we tried.
In any case, I want to be supportive of your pre-decision to go with the new '15 TLX SH-AWD, the Acura's can still make (for me) a pretty good value case, even if they are kind of an ""S4 lite."""
704,"June 26, 2014 2:44PM",wayne21,"Thank you, markcincinnati. I'm looking forward to the TLX coming out. Our neighbor just bought a BMW 330i with sport package. We alternate driving when we go out together and my wife doesn't like the car because it sits too low, rides too rough (rigid) and she thinks the interior is cheap (leatherette). I have owned a number of European cars (two while stationed there and two while living in the US) and I swore I'd never own another (frequent and high maintenance costs). We've been taking a lot of trips and will get serious about buying when we return from our trip to Maine in August. I think we're leaning toward Q50, TLX, maxima or murano, but my wife is likely to throw a curveball and pick something totally different. It is good to get honest feedback (educated) from people who own these cars, though."
705,"June 26, 2014 5:11PM",tlong,"The dilemma seems to be that nothing gives the passion of an Audi or BMW, but then there's the maintenance and repair costs if you keep the car a long time. With Acura you get Honda reliablity and 80-90% of the experience. I had an Audi and loved it but got rid of it sooner than most any other car. I have my Acura at 140K and it's been very reliable but I still miss the Audi..."
706,"June 26, 2014 6:16PM",flightnurse,"Just a FYI, your neighbots BMW is not a new one, since they do not have a 330i in the current line up."
707,"June 26, 2014 7:06PM",wayne21,"Maybe it's a 335. IDK. But I do know it's a 2014. They bought it off the showroom floor and it now has 1,200 miles on it after 2 months."
708,"June 27, 2014 11:32AM",markcincinnati,"The words reliable and durable do give my wife and me pause -- but, gulp, we went ahead and bought our first car EVER, the SQ5. I leased the S4, but with the intention of buying it off lease -- we'll see how the word durability holds up to time and miles.
With respect to reliability, however, I would have to say my European cars have not lacked reliability, but the longest I ever kept one was 66,000 miles (a 2005 Audi A6), so I am probably not the poster boy to tout European reliability.
My negative reliability experiences all have had to do with American cars -- and mostly Chrysler cars, at that. The thing is, as ""unreliable"" as the American cars proved to be, well, it was pretty close to impossible to KILL one of them -- so I guess I would say I've had unreliable, yet durable cars -- and I thought, at one point, ""why can't I have both?""
Sit down: Then I bought a brand new AMC ""American Eagle"" -- my first AWD car (pre Audi, if you can believe it -- but I am, after all 62 years old). Holy cow, talk about a rolling pile of junk -- if it wasn't welded on, it fell off. The brakes were ""same day"" affairs -- but the thing had a plaid cloth interior and a really cool steering wheel (leather wrapped). And, hey, it WAS AWD (I assume, after all, it was a Jeep with an AMC Concorde body mashed on the frame) and it would go where no one has gone before in all kinds of weather. This was pre-trail rated, but -- idiot that I was -- I took it soft roading and had no fear going at least a little bit off road, too.
Taking it into the dealer was a real treat, too -- something was always needing to be salved with money. I couldn't wait to be able to afford an Audi -- got my first FWD one in 1977 a 1978 5000.
Anyway, I guess I am at a point where I really do expect, nay, demand both reliability and durability -- I get your desire for the same and hence your conclusion to go Acura or Infiniti.
I'll echo, somewhat, the above statement by quoting my wife who I asked ""why not get another Infiniti -- the thing has been trouble free?""
Her reply: ""Infiniti ain't got no soul.""
In short: ""Cutty says 'e can't hang!"" (Airplane -- jive talk scene)

Told you I'm old."
709,"June 27, 2014 12:24PM",cdnpinhead,"Durability kicks in well after the warranty expires; the truly durable cars are owned by people who eventually get tired of not being able to find replacement parts because the car has been out of production for 10 or 15 years. My Datsun 510 was one of these, so I ended up with a Miata. Not such a bad outcome.
This is a concept lost on the majority of people who post here (or anywhere else)."
710,"June 27, 2014 12:35PM",wayne21,"I also had an audi 5000 and I spent a small fortune on mine. I bought it used (2 years old) when I first went to Ramstein Air Base Germany. It didn't have a lot of miles on it when I got it and it didn't have a lot of miles on it when I got rid of it, but it spent plenty of time getting little things fixed. My second assignment to Germany saw me getting a 318i. Great little car until it learned that I'd pay for electronic repairs. It seemed to have a mind of its own and loved to have little things fixed. In the US, I had 2 diesel rabbits (made about 50 miles from my hometown) and perhaps because they were ""diesel"" they provided a license to steal when they went to the shop. Lots of little things that nickel and dimed me to death.
I won't even go into the UAW-built cars I have owned. I will not even consider buying a car built by the UAW. Since going Japanese, I have been most happy. Very reliable! I think I'm going to stick with Japanese. My wife wants to ""step up"" a notch and thus the look at Infiniti and Acura. She says the Avalon is for ""old people"", but I know better than to ask what age she is talking about. She turns 59 next month and I know she wants something before she hits 60. To be honest, I can handle just about anything (other than European or UAW-built), but will buy whatever she likes. I'm pretty sure it will be Japanese."
711,"June 27, 2014 1:41PM",m6user,"In 2007, when looking for a car for my wife to commute in, I was down to a Jetta and the Mazda6. I have a nephew that is a VW tech and not a lightweight tech either. He was recruited from a dealership in Maryland to a huge dealership in a midwest city complete with all moving expenses and and nice up front bonus. I had no idea that auto mechanics had these kinds of opportunities. Anyway, I asked him if it were him which one would he choose and he asked me how long I planned on keeping the car. I told him if we liked the vehicle we usually kept a car for 6-7 years. He told me without a doubt get the Mazda or I would be a frequent visitor to the repair shop after warranty and it wouldn't be cheap. I think with his many years of experience he knew what he was talking about and took his advice. Her car has been absolutely trouble free for 7 years and 109k. Not a dime on repairs, just normal maint. Oh, I take that back.....I've replaced two light bulbs."
712,"June 27, 2014 1:50PM",flightnurse,"I think people confuse reliability with normal wear and tear items. If people plan on keeping care for years then spending money on routine maintenance will cost. My E46 3 series had no issues of reliability but I also made sure the services were kept up to-date. Right out of College, I went to work for Sony, I had bought a MB 300SDL (used) as my business car (yeah it was an over kill) and ended up turning into a Demo car for Sony car audio products. I bought the car with 36K miles on and after 10 yrs sold it with 225K miles on it. That car was stone reliable, but it was taken in to the dealer for it's services according to the maintenance book that was provided by MB. Three issues with the car after 100K where covered by MB because of known problems would be the only black eye I had with the car. I believe if you follow the recommended service for cars you wont have issues, granted I lost count of how many window regulators had to be replaced on the MB,."
713,"June 27, 2014 2:42PM",wayne21,"I, too, am a firm believer in preventative maintenance. In addition to what the factory suggests, I change oil & filter ever 4k miles, I flush the cooling system annually, I flush power steering fluid every 2 years, etc, etc, etc. I just got tired of little electrical things constantly being in need of repair, windshield seals leaking (VW), alternators going bad, relay switches going out, fan motor going out, etc."
714,"June 27, 2014 3:27PM",m6user,"I don't think many are confused between routine wear and tear vs. unexpected or repetitive repairs. Everyone knows oil has to be changed, brakes wear out, tires need replacing, etc."
715,"June 27, 2014 5:18PM",roadburner,"That is the reason I love my 1995 Club Sport; over 19 years, 138,000 miles, and countless HPDE laps it has only needed a thermostat, a heater hose fitting, 2 LCABs, a few bulbs, one set of pads/rotors and a couple of serpentine belt idler pulleys. Aside from that I just service the car according to the SI system, except that I change the brake fluid every six months when the car sees the track. And of course it has consumed several sets of EHP tires...
I am never selling it."
716,"June 28, 2014 8:03AM",graphicguy,"I have an awful lot of respect for the UAW. At one point in my life, I was a UAW member. They work hard, long hours, with pride. Go to the Corvette factory or the Jeep factory, and you'll see that all day, every day.
Have they outlived their usefullness? Perhaps, particularly given their inability to affect the recent automotive crisis (not sure they could have if they wanted to).
I love BMWs (x3). I love Acuras (x3), too. They're my two favorite brands. BMWs have robust drivetrains with many times sublime suspensions. They can and do cost more to maintain over time (first four years are covered, which means you have to deduct those maintenance fees in your equation). After that, you keep that maintenance up, and they car be reliable over a long period of time. Those charges are more than what I've experienced on an Acura.
Acuras will be reliable, for a long period of time, with little in the way of maintenance (certainly much cheaper than after warranty maintenance on a BMW).
Can't say one is better made than the other. Both have high quality materials.
Both brands are great in my estimation....for different reasons. Choice is good, though."
717,"June 28, 2014 9:37AM",wayne21,My issue with the UAW is the 5 UAW-built vehicles I bought. Bought them while in the service (retired military) thinking it was patriotic. Now believe it was stupidity that took me back to purchase another disaster. I now look at it a bit differently and think of it like this: IF I dated a woman and it was a disaster I probably wouldn't want to date her four sisters one after the other. Perhaps wisdom does come with age.
718,"June 28, 2014 5:51PM",flightnurse,You can't compare UAW cars from 20 years ago to the ones built today. I had my first Chrysler 200C 2015 model and was impressed with it. The new Chevy Impala as well as Malibu are lights years ahead in the cars they replace. The same with the Ford Fusion. Some of the blame really needs to go with the companies since they allowed those poorly built cars to leave the factory.
719,"June 28, 2014 6:25PM",robr2,...psst - lots of the parts in your Japanese or European car are made by UAW employees....

721,"June 28, 2014 7:46PM",sweendogy,"Reliability - since I was able to own my own car-let's rewind-
leased the 2000 acura integra gs-r, great car but again like most here it's a lease so didn't over due it with maintence besides oil and rotations, zero issues...it was a honda so bullet proof and prob the best car with an acura badge - certainly for under 25k at the time, (for those who will argue the NSX and 6 speed legend type 2 are better cars but cost thousands more)- this acura hit a snow bank and had its nose bent with its buggy eyes - was able to snap the plastic bumper back into place. The five speed throws I still have dreams about and the 8200? Rpm limit was something else, let's not forget about the start of v-tec, the v-tec where at 2 different levels you would get the umph. Man I should of bought that car, infact I extend the lease 4 extra months because I had no ideas what to get next.
03- wanted a 6 with a 6- few options - considered Cl, thing Mazda had the 6, wanted a 330 but inflated price, went with jetta gli. Car while very attractive with heated cloth sports seats and nice rims had issue ps with monsoon radio as it had a passenger volume bias that drove me insane at times. Went back to dealer 10 times in 3 years for non-oil changes. Car was purchased at a good deal and after 4 yr warrantee was up I was quick to exchange at good value for the loved Infiniti g.- at the end was very worried I would spend a lot of time at VW.
07- g35x - great car- sure it was now an auto, and a bigger sedan but with the power and yhe tech could not be beat at the time, considered many others but nothing compared at the cost. Had the car for 7 model years, went back for brakes, bought new tires and had a issue with the window seals- at the end I also had it back for a drive train belt that snaped on way to work, car was towed and work done at dealer for a cost around 200 bux. Best car you could own- but at the end I thought with the tech and power it was a good idea to move on.
Audi 13 s4 - 17k or so - I've owned for 3500 miles no issues yet- but knowing the costs and brand I will be monitoring and deciding around warrantee time on next move. So much tech, power and random items to worry about, I am not a person who wants to spend a lot on a car, and would rather downgrade then deal
with the added cost. Sorry about the long post-"

729,"June 30, 2014 1:46PM",markcincinnati,"Other than the easy answer: Marketing or Money, why can't we upgrade our cars telematics and other electronic items?
I don't know if you know this, but Audis come with a pretty neat technology called ""Audi Connect."" It is provided at no charge for 6 months then it is simply shut off if you don't elect to subscribe to it (at $30 per month or the equivalent of $15 per month for a $450 lump sum payment).
Audi connect through 2014 MY's utilizes T-Mobile as a carrier to provide Internet connectivity and the ability to turn your car into a WiFi hotspot. Using Audi connect and apparently some neat software from Google, many desirable features are offered that are probably worth up to $15 per month on a month-to-month payment plan.
The thing is the carrier is T-Mobile. I can't begin to tell you how poor T-Mobile is -- and when it is at full-strength, it is 3G, very slow and often drops down to 2G, and, well, has very poor signal coverage here in our River City.
Sitting right on the showroom floor, however, is a new Premium+ A3 with 4G LTE AT&T Audi connect. It fires right up, goes about 3 or 4 times faster and is quicker to start-up to boot.
So Audi calls me and wants me to re-up my Audi connect plan -- I do offer $15 per month paid monthly, not $450 in one lump -- IF I can swap out the simm card or the radio itself, for a new carrier -- AT&T would be fine, so would Verizon.
Now I do understand that you may be loving T-Mobile if you're in certain areas of the US. But what may be good in Baltimore sucks in Cincinnati from a phone coverage, speed and drop-out perspective.
I've had Sprint, Verizon and AT&T (currently with AT&T since I got off my BlackBerry -- which was RIMM wasn't it?) The only service I've ever had any issues with is, you guessed it T-Mobile.
You'd think there is a little radio device behind the face of the dashboard that is, after all, a cell-phone. Just like when I got rid of the BlackBerry and went with the iPhone (and changed service providers), there ought to be a way to swap out the tech -- not buy a whole new car for pity's sake.
My friend has a private plane -- the thing must be a million years old, but ""the avionics"" are as current as can be just as the engine and the whole plane are ""overhauled"" annually to keep them ""jus like new"".
It seems to me that the electronic features of these cars hits the showroom floor one generation behind (sometimes more); wouldn't you win friends (and customers) and influence people if you could market your cars as having the ability to be kept current (at least insofar as some ""electronic"" systems are concerned?)
I probably answered my own question, the reason these systems are not ""allowed"" to be updated with new tech has to do with marketing and money not feature and function.
I'd re-up for Audi connect in a heartbeat -- but not with T-Mobile as the service provider; what are you nuts?"

Funny that you would say that. I have read Q50 forums that complain about the technology problems - essentially ""not ready to be marketed"". 30 seconds for the backup camera to come one; no lines on the backup camera. Come on - I think these things are standard equipment on a Toyota corolla! My neighbors new BMW 335i sport package - he didn't get the backup camera because it was a $900 option. $900 option for a backup camera? I think most cars, even economy cars, come standard with a backup camera."

I let mine expire and have not missed it- my iphone does everything better. I say save the 15 bux. The bmw charging 900 bux for something should not be a surprise- they charge for everything. Think about the poor sob who thinks he got a deal on a 320 and lives up east. 40k with a nav and 180hp.
733,"June 30, 2014 6:44PM",m6user,2014 Lexus RX350 doesn't have lines in the backup camera. I don't know if the Corolla does or not.

737,"July 3, 2014 9:59AM",markcincinnati,"The 2012 TL I had, did have ""lines"" that would eventually pop up on the backup camera image -- but they did not articulate to track with the steering wheel -- these fixed lines were, in my opinion, worse than no lines.
My wife's FX, on the other hand had the ""all-around-view"" monitor -- now THAT's valuable tech and sadly is only available on BMW's and Audi's of a certain model and/or with a special (high cost) driver assistance package.
I did test drive the X3 with the top view monitor and it was about 90% as good as the Infiniti -- and of course was breathtakingly expensive compared to the Infiniti.
Interesting ""opinion"" from Bob Lutz in the current R&T magazine in response to a question posed to him essentially wondering why German cars are often held up as the zenith of automobiles.
Lutz essentially gave a response that said something like this: ""German cars used to be at the top, and they still may be, but everyone else can do the same thing as the Germans these days.""
I would assume Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Porsche and VW, too, would beg to differ.
Although, there is a point there -- when C&D crowns #1 to a Lexus in a comparison article and the BMW 3 series is #2, you know the times they are (at least once) a changin'.
Still loving the S4 -- but every time I see the IS350 F-Sport, I do pause for a nano second -- there, I'm over it.
Happy Fourth, Campers"
738,"July 3, 2014 11:29AM",qali,"I have a 2008 TL and a 2013 MDX. The TL does not have lines but a fairly decent rear camera. The MDX has the ""lines"" and 3 views from 2 cameras. Fairly accurate and reliable. However, I still turn my head around to get a wider perspective on what's around. Now, my 2011 335i 2-door does not have a camera but an outstanding proximity sensor system. I find this system more reliable because it audibly warns me of every obstacle on the entire rear side of the vehicle when reversing. Comes in very handy when backing up into my tight garage.
Regarding the German vs. Japanese car comparison, both my Acuras are great vehicles and I will not trade them. However, my BMW gives me a smile each time I accelerate around a turn. The interior ergonomics are ""different"" and takes time to learn but the quality of materials and engineering is first rate. Take for example the windshield wipers. BMW perhaps makes one of the best wipers in the business. The rain-sensing wipers have never let me down even during driving in heavy rains at 80-90 mph because the vehicle is designed from the ground up to be driven fast. Same goes for my headlights which are bi-level xenon. With my poor eyesight and sensitivity to glare, the BMW is the only car I take out at night because they make absolutely wonderful auto-dimming exterior and interior mirrors. Even the seat belt assist (who I lovingly refer to by name) has an intelligence to it and does not extend if there is no one in the passenger seat, the door is not closed, or if the car is in Drive. These are subtleties and design elements that still make, in my opinion, the German cars stand out from Japanese counterparts.
Sorry for the long post."
739,"July 3, 2014 1:05PM",wayne21,"I went to dinner last night with a friend in her new Honda civic. The backup camera has lines and the move to adjust to the steering wheel. When the right turn signal is pushed (or when pushing in on the end of the turn signal ""pole"") a camera comes on showing the right side of the car (i.e. blind spot) and that camera also has lines. Interesting that this technology comes standard in the civic. I believe it was a base civic as it had cloth interior and no satellite radio."

742,"July 3, 2014 4:05PM",nyccarguy,"That's sort of an ongoing discussion here. It's all in the eye of the beholder. Do you value the ""luxury"" or the ""performance?""

For $35K (MSRP) you can get an Accord Touring with every single bell, whistle, & piece of latest technology available today or you could get a lightly optioned Audi A3 or Mercedes-Benz CLA 250.

But you enjoy driving- 99% of people behind the wheel are ""operators"" at best- and they are attracted by bells and whistles. When I covered the intro of the E93 I noted that it would sell like hotcakes even if it had the driving dynamics of a Chevrolet Cobalt..."
744,"July 3, 2014 7:21PM",msusox80,"Hmmm disagree with the statement that 99% of drivers are operators. Or if it is true, than bmw has built its company on that 1% of people that prefer the majority of cost in a car to be in the engine/suspension/driving dynamics (when bmw drivers call the interiors ""driver focused"" this is code for not as fancy/nice/supple as other cars in those price ranges). I think they're recent expansion into more comfortable, diverse cars is simply an attempt to take market share in other categories. Anyone that says ""bmw is deviating from their core customer"", just doesn't have any common business sense.

First Class as usual- valet parking, open bar, all manner of hors d'oeuvres, and a raffle for an iPad3. The new 3er is an attractive piece, but my thoughts were straying to a 2011 135i M Sport over in the Pre-Owned lot.
Pathetic story of the evening: I'm looking at 328i Sport Line and a salesman asks me what I think. I tell him that it's nice, but that it is missing a pedal(the car has a slushbox). A guy standing next to him says ""I like automatics- I want to get in the car and not have to do anything."" I told him that if I can't take the car on the track I'm not buying it- and the guy replies, ""I'd never take my car to the track; especially after I spent three hours washing it."" My son(17 at the time, driving a 1975 2002) laughed about ""The Dork"" for the rest of the evening, but all I could do was silently pray: ""Dear Lord, deliver the BMW marque from all poseurs. Cast them all into the Lake of Fire- or even worse, make them drive an Aveo, Festiva, or Yaris for all Eternity."""

763,"July 7, 2014 11:54AM",markcincinnati,"I am probably wrong in concluding that those of us who write down our opinions and push POST COMMENT here are not exactly the kind of folks who these ELLPS car companies are marketing to. But, then again, I might be right.
The comment somewhere, ""it's missing a pedal"" is one I personally relate to -- but, well that's two of us. Audi, BMW, et al, certainly WANT our money -- but there is probably very little (if any at all) financial reason to offer 6-speed manual transmissions any more.
We're lucky -- I think -- to have the wonderful 7-speed DSG unit that Audi uses in several of its cars, I'm as fine as wine with that transmission. Heck, I've even come 'round to the 8-speed tiptronic when tuned for performance shifting.
And, even were I not happy with the 8-speed Audis and BMWs and the 7-speed unit employed by Mercedes, well, I really don't count much anymore.
BMW is selling a lot of cars these days -- up over 12%. The super-majority of these sales, I assume, came with automatic transmissions. Good for BMW. Ditto at Audi and MB -- at least I assume so. It has been ""forever"" (2004 or 2005) since I saw, let alone drove a manual transmission at an Audi or BMW dealership. My last stick was an Audi allroad -- 2003 model.
My wife's last stick was a 2005 BMW X3 3.0. Since then we've had a 2005 A6, a 2008 X3, an Infiniti 2011 FX35, a 2009 Audi A4, a 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD and now a 2014 S4 and SQ5.
In this (the examples of the cars we've owned) one way, our buying probably represents more of what most ""real"" people actually buy. Although I would argue that those who buy Audi's S and RS cars and BMW's M's, and Mercedes AMG's no matter how poshed-up, may not be the manufacturers' main, or primary customers.
If BMW 3 series cars really have fallen out of favor with many of their previous customers, I would agree (with whoever posted this idea) that for every ""die hard Bimmer-file"" that leaves the fold, several new to the fold customers come on-board. Ditto the message for Audi and Mercedes -- lose 1, gain 5 (or whatever the number might be).
There were die-hard horse and buggy customers -- back in the day -- too.
Giddy-up?"
764,"July 7, 2014 2:54PM",cdnpinhead,"No one has every gone broke underestimating the taste of the Amerian public -- H.L. Mencken.
I want a medium-displacement diesel with a manual transmission. These days, VW is the only show in town, and their reliability (yeah, I know . . . I should be prepared to tolerate ""breathtakingly expensive"") is somewhat suspect.
What I'd like is a BMW 320 or 325 diesel with a manual transmission, since they've not yet discontinued RWD -- they're available in the thousands outside of the CARB-driven North American market. As a second choice, I could deal with an Audi A3 diesel with a manual. Or, I could go piss up a rope.
What I want isn't available, so I continue to tolerate what I can get. I presently drive an Acura TSX from the pre-beak era with a very nice manual transmission that drives the wrong set of wheels. It's been stone-reliable (well, there was the blower motor issue that I dealt with a month or so ago) for the whole time I've driven it (approaching 100K miles), but I've never forgiven Acura for not bringing in the diesel TSX that was promised for the model year following my purchase of the gasser that I drive. Guess what -- they couldn't meet CARB.
I drove my first modern diesel in Europe 13 years ago and have been waiting ever since for the opportunity to buy one here. I'm getting older by the day. I don't think it'll ever happen. Thanks, CARB."
765,"July 7, 2014 5:51PM",sweendogy,Soon you most likely will also be looking overseas for a manual transmission along with said RWD diesel.
766,"July 8, 2014 4:49AM",cdnpinhead,"Would if I could, but the EPA has rendered that choice impossible."
767,"July 8, 2014 8:28AM",flightnurse,"It's not the EPA but the buying public. VW sells both manual and DSG transmissions, the DSG transmissions out sell the manual. Yes, this is a FWD, however, the modern day auto is best suited for the oil burner, and with people exceeding the EPA rating in the BMW 328d this wouldn't happen with a manual transmission. Also the only manufactures of RWD diesel are the Europeans i doubt they will import a manual."

Everyone here is under 55 years of age. I am over 60.
The baby boomers MAY be the last gen to both understand and appreciate manual transmission cars.
I usually use the phrase ""hand in glove"" when I describe stick shift driving.
I did test drive an Audi S4 manual ('14 MY) before ending up with the S-tronic.
The S-tronic was THAT good. Besides there are some few instances when I must use a valet -- my recollection of valeting my 2003 allroad were gear-grindingly painful.

771,"July 8, 2014 11:33AM",roadburner,"That is not a very accurate analogy; the BMW enthusiasts I know aren't clamoring for the return of carburetors or deletion of ABS systems; I'd even hazard a guess that most could make peace with a decent DCT/DSG as well. What they DO find objectionable is BMW's current penchant for making their cars bigger, heavier, and more insulated from the driving experience. As I've noted before, I've spent considerable seat time in several F10s and F30s and I find my son's 2004 X3 and my Mazdaspeed 3 to be far more involving drives. BMW is coming in second or third in many magazine comparisons, and their novocain-infused steering and poor ride/handling balance are a major reason for their poor showing."

I've noted on several occasions that I think the current F30 Body 3 series would ""out-handle"" my AWD E90 328xi on a skid pad or road course. The chassis is stronger and tighter. The car is faster. But I don't know for sure because I can't feel what's going on. Its not that the current 3 series isn't a nice car. If I drove one and it was my 1st time ever driving a BMW, I wouldn't lust after it and WANT it like I did when I first drove my friend's 1995 E36 325is (SP - MT). It isn't like my Prelude with its 200 hp @ 7000 RPM & 156 lb ft of torque @ 5250 RPM that begs me to drive it every time I get behind the wheel even after over 152K miles & 12 years."

Now with the CAFE # needing to be improved all manufactures need to increase their numbers, and BMW went with Elec steering, now this can be blamed on the EPA. I also blame the oil companies, they keep diesel product low (they say there is no demand for it) but I have to say is there really a demand for mid-grade too? IF diesel was between regular and premium in price, then the advantage is really there to switch."
778,"July 9, 2014 6:18PM",wayne21,"I was checking some other forums and found some interesting specs that have recently been released for the 2015 TLX. Amazingly enough, the interior of the new TLX is smaller than a Honda civic.

EPA Passenger Volume = 93.3 cu ft
EPA Cargo Volume = 13.2 cu ft for base and Tech (14.3 cu ft for Advance)
EPA Total Interior Volume = 106.5/107.6 cu ft
Compared to
As far as the Civic comparison, the 2014 Civic has an EPA rated interior volume of 107.1 cu ft total. Of this total, the cargo volume is 12.5 cu ft. **Meaning that the passenger volume for the Civic is 94.6 cu ft. **
Even the Civic is larger inside the passenger cabin than the 2015 TLX by 1.3 cu ft.
It is important to note that the 2014 Accord provides 119 cu ft of interior volume. This is more than 10 cu ft more than the 2015 TLX that only has 107.6 in the Advance model.
I assume the interior will be nicer than a civic, but I think my interest in the TLX has just died. I'm sure there are pros and cons about this, but I think I'm going to pass."
779,"July 10, 2014 5:23AM",cdnpinhead,"I bought my '08 TSX specifically because it was smaller -- it was the Accord sold in the rest of the world. It also had a suspension designed for something other than isolation from the road and an excellent 6-speed manual. I am not of the opinion that bigger is better (I realize that I'm in the minority here as well), but reading these posts helps me understand why the Civics of today are bigger than the Accords of yesteryear."
780,"July 10, 2014 6:47AM",graphicguy,"I know the wife's current gen Accord is as big as my 4th gen TL SH AWD, even though it's shorter.
I would imagine the same will be true for the upcoming TLX. Probably the way it's packaged with useable space, will be as big or bigger than the current Accord. You really have to look at the entire picture. Packaging efficiency makes a big difference in passenger comfort/room.
My wife really wanted one of the last TSXs. There just weren't many on dealer's lots, and she felt the TL was too big. So, she settled on an Accord (which she does love)."
781,"July 10, 2014 8:07AM",markcincinnati,"As nice as the Accord may be, and even including the fact that the Honda is somewhat larger factored in, too, well, the TLX will offer PAWS and SH-AWD. These features put the TLX into another performance category (and the TLX will also offer an 8-speed transmission and a ""sport tuned"" suspension.)
Folks that shop for Acuras do so, I think, because they don't want a Honda (hence Acura's efforts to distance the Acura lineup from Honda products as much as the corporate checkbook will tolerate).
These two cars aren't really competitive [with each other] if you axed me. The new TLX, I would assume will end up being in comparison tests with the Infiniti Q50S AWD and the Lexus IS350 AWD, to name just two.
The Infiniti and the Lexus may have an initial advantage since they are -- ""foundationally"" -- based on RWD chassis. Of course, I wouldn't count out the impact of the PAWS and SH-AWD technology making for perhaps a more interesting showdown.
Certainly these cars will want to be included in the same sentences with a BMW 3 and even the somewhat aging A4/S4 family, but I do believe the TLX will work like crazy to position itself as the alternative vehicle (alternative to the Infiniti and Lexus, to be sure).
I'll end where I began, the Acura TLX, perhaps for the first time in years, seems to have distanced itself more from the [Honda] Accord. I'll be so nutz as to suggest these two cars will rarely be cross shopped (other than perhaps the BASE FWD TLX vs the Accord).
Often wrong, never uncertain, I remain."

Not an ELLPS, but he ended up buying a manual Focus. One of the advantages we sold him on was that he wouldn't likely have to be the bad guy when non-vehicle owning students wanted to borrow his car. Sorry man, I would let you, but it's a manual shift. Still, I was pleased that he learned and wanted to continue to use his skill.

Yes, the A4 also is normally front wheel drive, but they have spent decades perfecting AWD in their cars. An A4 with AWD is a very good car to drive.

A little sobering, actually. The 320i has such a weak engine given the price you pay. BMW should just stop selling it and make the 328i the entry level model. (the 0-60 for the Mustang? not listed, but it's 5.7 seconds)"
801,"July 17, 2014 11:40AM",graphicguy,"Yeah....my sister is looking to load one up, I think somewhere in that low $40s range. Out the door around $37K, maybe?
Pickins are getting slim, given the '15s are right around the corner. '14 you get what you get. She wants mineral white with tan leather, plus nag, winter pack, etc. '14 she gets $1K incentive. '15 she has to order, but can get exactly what she wants....no $1K incentive.

If the dealer really wants to make a sell, they will do a dealer trade, take MSRP - 7% this is a good start on any 3 series, then subtract the 1K from that. Now since you are previous BMW owner they might give her another 1K off. Is she buying or leasing? Do you know about MSD's?"

806,"July 17, 2014 9:06PM",flightnurse,"Stick, the 320i goes 0-60 in 6.7 sec, faster then a Hyundai Sonata Turbo or Kia Optima Turbo that have 274hp. Stops from 60-0 in 106 feet. Overall I'm happy with the car, and extra boost added has given what the 320i needed. Now for 2015, the 320i will get a power boost, officially BMW has not stated what is it, but talk is between 200-210hp, the 328i is also getting a power boost too.
Now the new M3/4 are nice cars, but are they practical? Some people will say yes and some will say no. But BMW wont have a problem selling every single one. But then again, some people are happy at buying a used car while others don't. The 320 has sold very well for BMW and I'm sure it will continue to do so."

Her ""wants"" are a bit different than a ""price"" buyer......mineral white, tan leather, nav, xDrive. All that makes a loaded up 320i. And, price wise, you creep into 328i territory. But, she's not a speed demon. I think her salesperson hit it on the head when he said the 320i is the car that BMW wants to sell to hook people on the brand, regardless of what they are coming from. Really good suspension and toss able, as it's much lighter than my previous 335i coupe.
Audi is off the table based on hearing of my experience.
C class was underwhelming....still a $45K car with some equipment added on, that felt ponderous compared to the 320i.
CLA......really good looking car.....but in reality that is the ONLY thing it has going for it.
She was shocked that the Jag (XF?) she looked at had a sticker of close to $60K. Not sure what she paid for her ""S"" type a dozen years ago, but I didn't think it would have been that big of a jump. So, Jag is off the table.

811,"July 18, 2014 6:41PM",markcincinnati,"We live in a little town about 20 miles north of the CBD of Cincinnati. The routes to get from home to the CBD (approximately where my wife and I work), include I-71, looping around from north to south by sort of going east on I-275 and heading down the back road (or so it seems) of Wooster Pike and SR 50.
OK, with that much info at hand, I must say it is virtually impossible to use more than a relatively small fraction of the potential of an S4 or SQ5. I had, for about 5 seconds, thought it would be cool to change out the supercharger pulley and engine management software for more torque and horsepower.
But to what end?
There are so few opportunities where I can push my S4 -- I, so far, literally overtake every other car on any of the above mentioned hi-ways and roads. The ""joy"" of punching it on a freeway entrance ramp is something I would love to do -- unfortunately the acceleration is so quick (sub 50-seconds to 100kph) I overtake everything and end up hitting the brakes hard.
I wouldn't give up the feeling of deep wells of power and torque that these S cars offer -- but I must say, it has become virtually impossible to ""play with"" the power offered in a sane and unselfish manner.
Tuning the Auidi S's or the ""35"" BMW engines would certainly boost their power, torque and therefore increase their ""accelerative"" force and overall thrust -- but I have now reached the point that I see no merit in chipping, changing out the exhaust system, etc, since I can't use (and enjoy) the factory force available.
I assume the same frustrations are ""enjoyed"" by certain Cadillac, Mercede, Volvo, Porsche and other ""sported up"" model owners -- at least if you live in just about any medium to large US city.
You finally get a modern ""hot rod"" and you literally can only tap into a fraction of its capabilities.
Kind of a drag."
812,"July 18, 2014 7:42PM",roadburner,My two favorite cars in the garage are the fastest(MS3) and the slowest(Club Sport). And I have absolutely no problem pushing either to the edge of their respective performance envelopes- that's what HPDEs are for!
813,"July 19, 2014 8:37AM",markcincinnati,"I have been to no less than 8 HPDEs and you are correct roadburner, you can push the cars (however the HPDEs I have attended supplied the cars for us, we weren't allowed to use our own). However, I was thinking more of the ""everyday"" that I ""remember"" from past years.
I'm not suggesting I want to get on a crowded (and ours almost always are) interstate and floor it, consequences be damned. My ""wistful"" intents are more to find a relatively deserted stretch where I can ""punch it"" with the only concern being getting a speeding ticket, not endangering the clog of cars (and their drivers and passengers, of course).
Of our many trips to Germany, some of my fondest memories have to do with taking my BMW, Mercedes or Audi rental on the autobahn and driving from Berlin to Munich where there are some fairly long stretches of the autobahn that have no speed limit.
During those driving moments I had no sense of danger or that our collective high speeds were reckless. Here, as the freeways are ever more crowded and people pass on the right or sit in the far left lane and cruise along below the posted speed limit, driving has become much more like work -- and increasingly risky work at that.
We'll go to an HPDE perhaps once or twice every five years -- always love them, but I guess I'm looking for an American Autobahn -- not gonna happen in my lifetime.
Next up our cars are going to (already are) provide ever more driver aids that take the wheel, accelerator and brake away from us.
Driving and our car culture are changing -- and I am, usually, in favor of the change. This time, however, what I am longing for is my memory restricted return to having fun behind the wheel as we did not that many years ago.
It's the weekend, it's summer -- I'm going to go out and find a curvy ""back road"" (whatever that means anymore) and carve it up.
I'll get over it in a minute.
There, I'm over it."
814,"July 19, 2014 9:05AM",roadburner,"Driving at high speeds in virtually a straight line gets boring after a while. Fortunately my job involves a lot of driving and I often choose to take a nearly deserted rural two lane as opposed to a dull interstate slog, which allows me to enjoy the handling prowess of whichever car I'm driving. The Club Sport requires a bit of finesse and the ability to conserve momentum. You have to make sure it is always in the right gear at the right time(fortunately the pedal placement is ideal for heel/toe downshifts). In contrast, the MS3-fitted with Koni FSDs and Michelin PSS tires-simply bludgeons the road to death; just leave it in third gear, turn in really late with a bit of trailing brake, and nail the throttle once you see daylight(or, as I've said before, visualize obedience training a bipolar pit bull that is mainlining crystal meth).
Think of it this way: if the Club Sport is a Steyr SSG 69, the MS3 is a Colt AR-15 with an extended capacity magazine."
815,"July 19, 2014 10:04AM",graphicguy,"Loved the power of both the 335i and the S4. Seems Audi has issues with some of the cars that use recent iterations of their Quattro system, as I've seen mention in some of the trade rags about the same ""grinding"" issues I experienced.
There wasn't much on the road that could beat you in stop light wars, though. It would have to be a very recent muscle car, and the persin driving it would have to know how to launch. Or, AMG, RS, M, etc tuner cars. Aside from that, not much can touch them.
That said, I do think the TL SH AWD, while not as fast in a straight line vs the S4 or 335i (but certainly more than capable), feels more balanced, confidence inspiring and entertaining in its own right. Then, there's the elephant in the room....the significant price difference

I live in the West where it's possible to drive at very high speeds on virtually deserted roads, and I enjoy doing so. I also spend far too much time in commuter traffic, but that can be more pleasant driving the proper vehicle.
That said, the capabilities of most of the ""watch me and what I dirve"" cars are never even approached, unless you live out here, where there's a bit less of the ""watch me"" culture. Certainly more than there used to be (which was zero), but not so much.

841,"July 30, 2014 8:09AM",graphicguy,"So, last weekend, by invite, I went to the BMW drive event at my local BMW dealer.
Always a fun event. For those unfamiliar with it, BMW, through the local dealer, allows you to drive their cars, and the competitors' models, back-to-back.
I chose the 435i xDrive, as that is the successor to my beloved former 335ix coupe (E82). Total redesign....interior and exterior. As best as I could tell, the drivetrain is a little ""tamer"" in the 435. But, that could be because I had a performance package on my former coupe. Still, these are Bavarian muscle cars.
The uncommunicative steering was the most noticeable. It's not that the steering wasn't up to the chore of spirited driving. It's that you were never sure if it could do what you asked it to do. You pointed it, and the car followed, but I was never sure it would. Maybe with time and experience, you get used to it. I preferred the steering in my E92.
The other big complaint is that people felt they made the suspension to soft. I don't get that. I think the suspension is a worthy upgrade to the suspension in the E92. It soaks up broken pavement better, even at speed, without unduly upsetting the cabin. Not a huge difference over the E92 mind you. But, a worthy one. I liked it.
The new 4 is definitely bigger than my previous 3. I liked my E92. I like the F32, I think. It definitely has more ""creases"" (my technical term). Headlights are the same with the BMW ""ring"" DRLs. Plenty of room.
My tester did not have the sports seats. Coming from the sports seats in my TL SH AWD (which are some of the best in the biz, IMHO), this was immediately noticeable. Wasn't a fan of them in my E92. Still not a fan of the standard seats in the F32.
Nice dash with color heads up display.....EXCEPT.....the display disappears when wearing sun glasses. Usually BMW thinks these types of things through. This time they failed. Kind of defeats the purpose of a HUD if you can see it only on overcast days.
Whose idea was it to make that auto shifter so convoluted? It's a beer tap looking thingy. In unfortunate BMW fashion, instead of just putting it in ""D"" or ""R"" depending on what you want, you push a button, pull a lever, do this, do that, just to put it in gear. Why make something so simple, so complex?
Stereo was the standard one. I had the HK in my E92. The standard stereo is worse than the HK. The HK wasn't all that great to begin with. Neither is all that good compared to the one in my TL (ELS)....not even close.
The iDrive has evolved. It only took BMW over a decade to get it to a reasonable level of operation and ease of use. But, it's now good. You can write on the top of the little dial between the seats to input a letter. Not so good while driving. A little better when stopped. Not nearly as good as the same Audi technology on the A6 w/Nav. As has been mentioned before, the NAV screen looked like an afterthought.
The ""start/stop"" technology seems a bit smoother than the last one I drive in a 4 cal 328i. Still needs work, though.
Usually I don't sit in the back seat, particularly in a coupe. I tried it out with the 4, though. Entrance and exit weren't bad, given the (slow) electric seats that will move out of the way. But, if you're looking for cost cutting, this is where you'll find it. Back seat was filled with hard plastics that sounded very ""cheap"" when you knocked on them.
All-in-all, still drives like a BMW. Offers good handling, and decent comfort, all while going fast.....very fast. On a tech note, BMW has joined those in the top tier. iDrive is good and offers everything you could want and is relatively easy to use.
If you want the ""snob"" appeal, the BMW muscle car feel, the maintenance and warranty that covers practically everything, and the uber good BMW dealership experience where they take care of everything for you, this is your choice.
At a price, that is. My tester had an MSRP of $57K. For that kind of money (and for a whole lot less), you can find other cars that are just as good, if not better.
Still, I have a soft spot for the 3 series (now the 4). They do a whole lot really, really well. The dealer experience is superlative. I know they are the car to lease vs buy. So, maybe I'm not the person they're targeting.

843,"July 30, 2014 11:21AM",roadburner,When I went to the Ultimate Drive at my dealer they had a 435i M Sport fitted with just about every M Performance accessory you can get. A 4er similarly equipped would be one of the few new BMWs I would actually want to own.
844,"July 30, 2014 11:39AM",graphicguy,"Mr Shiftwright.....the Benz C350 4matic wasn't a car I expected to like, but surprisingly did. Probably not a good thing for a BMW comparison drive event. I just went with my sister to help her buy a C300 4Matic sedan.
The coupe felt like a different car. The engine was stronger than the C300. It gave up some power to the really excellent twin scroll turbo 6 in the 335i. But, in the Benz, the 3.5L felt quick, I'd dare to say, fast enough (about the same as my seat of the pants feel in my TL). It was smooth. I think it may have had ""start/stop"" technology. But, compared to the BMW's implementation, it was so hard to tell, it might not have. Just goes to show what a little better engineering for something like that can achieve.
The C, while entertaining to drive, seemed more relaxed in doing it than the BMW. Granted, the BMW was probably better when driving at 10/10ths. The Benz felt better everywhere else in the driving experience.
The Benz was easier to drive fast than the BMW. I'd say that's true of the Benz over my previous S4, too. It's not as fast on an absolute basis. But, it's easier to drive fast in every day driving.
The suspension really did offer a good ride/handling feel....very well sorted, with a premium ride that not so much isolated you, but made it so you really didn't care of there was broken pavement underneath you. It stayed eminently composed while not doing anything untoward while traveling around corners and/or over bad pavement.
Materials.....very nice. The one I drove had leather......good leather....extra cost leather. Seats were better than in the BMW, but still not quite as good as in the TL. Same goes for the stereo (H/K, again). Not bad, but not nearly as good as the ELS in the Acura.
All the other materials, and their execution/build, etc were a ⅓ step above the BMW. Very nicely done...felt expensive....even the way the dials worked.
Where it falls down...who in the world designed the cruise/turn signals? How can you use one without engaging the other. They're both on the same side of the steering wheel, in the same vicinity. Somebody at Mercedes needs to lose their job over that design faux pas.
The nav and knob system felt a couple of generations behind BMW's iDrive or the Nav/buttons in my Acura. The Mercedes took forever to boot up. Once it did, it seems it took multiple inputs to do even the simplest tasks.
Whereas you could find areas of cost cutting in the BMW, you found no such items anywhere in the Benz. Everything looked, felt and functioned with a premium look and operational feel.
So, to sum up. The C350 4matic coupe is fast, comfortable, handles well, rides well, feels premium.....AND.....
It was $2K-$3K cheaper than a ""like for like"" 435ix BMW. Icing on the cake....while subjective....I found the Mercedes to look lots better than the BMW, too.
While you may get the premium customer treatment at Mercedes, maintenance is extra cost. From what I understand, a fair amount of extra cost. Perhaps this is one of those cars you never take back to the dealership for routine maintenance. Maybe this is one you get to know an indecent mechanic who is fair in what they charge."

I still have a soft spot for BMWs. I'm really interested in the new TLS. But, I won't be in the market for another 2-3 years, so it really doesn't matter right now, at least for me.

Personally? That '14 C350 coupe is mighty sweet. I'd be tempted to get it instead of waiting.
I also learned that the C350 coupe is relatively hard to come by vs the much more common C250. That's kind of like the 428i being much easier to find than the 435i with BMW."

They all make the point that plopping in a 328/335 similarly equipped with similar performance is going to run way up the price scale. And, as was pointed out, like Audi and BMW, Acura's style is evolutionary, not revolutionary.
As previously mentioned, I want to hold onto my TL SH AWD at least until the warranty is up....which won't be for another couple of years. As it stands, I've had two oil changes and two tire rotations in 17,000 miles. That's it. I think maintenance has cost me about $140 in the 1.5 years I've had it.

Great write up on the 435i & C350. There are a few things the current (outgoing) C has going for it. Good old hydraulic, belt driven, power steering. An adaptive suspension that reacts to road conditions & steering inputs (electronically). MB is a big company and can throw major incentives in the form of trunk money, cheap financing, & attractive lease rates.
I agree that price is a factor, even when you get north of $50K."
868,"August 4, 2014 8:50PM",graphicguy,"Stick....thanks.
Get this out of the way up front, The TLX looks much better in person than the pics I've seen.
Dealer had two cars....one black with a sweet dark saddle interior. i really like that combo. The other one was white with black interior.
The interiors are a big upgrade over mine, and pretty much turns it into a leader in the segment. All controls move with precision and smoothness that lead the pack.
The 4 has an 8 speed, dual clutch trans. Fun drive. The DCT performs extremely well. Steering is light, and precise. It tightens up well as you gain speed....very linear.
Gun it, and it leaps. Quick, firm shifts with ""blip"" matching revs. It's as roomy inside as my TL. They say it has shorter front and rear overhangs. Maybe. Not sure. Plenty of rear seat room.
Seat of pants tells me 0-60 around 6-6.5 secs.
Leather is good...better than the fake stuff other brands tout. Better than most premium leathers in other premium brands.
Dual screens...top one for NAV. Bottom one for audio and HVAC. This car will compete well with 4 cyl A4s, 320/8i, C300 4 cyl.
The V6 was a FWD Advance. It was as loaded as any car I've ever driven. 9 speed push button trans. It's always in the right gear and will run to redline in every gear. It will snap to any gear firmly....right now!
Great seats, very high quality materials. Super quiet. Again...steering was light but tightened up at speed.
Suspension is really refined and sophisticated...comparable to a much more expensive car. Nothing seems to upset it....and I tried.
I expect 0-60 to be in the low to mid 5s. Like the 4, it loves to run and sounds/feels smooth, typical Acura motors. These just seem to want run hard.
P-AWS is slick....you point.....it goes...no drama, understeer well controlled....as fast as you dare to go.
I saw the MSRP of the V6 Advance.....~$42K. Not sure about the 4 cyl. That includes the ELS surround system (best I've heard in a car), lane keeping, intelligent cruise, sunroof, really nice leather, remote start...everything. A BMW 3 or 4, A/S4, C class would easily cost an extra $10K to $15K for something similar. Dealer said Acura is giving $1,500 discount and $500 in ""add-ons"" for anyone trading an '08 on up.
They had two demos (which I drove). But had sold the 4 they got in stock Last weekend.
This car is going to be a hit. Plus, the headlights are really cool."
869,"August 5, 2014 7:11AM",stickguy,"Makes me want one. The 4 would be plenty for me. 2 weeks back when I was in for service the salesman said the were giving a preorder discount, plus the $500 in ad dons if you put a deposit down to get on the list.
Does sound like it could be a hit."
870,"August 5, 2014 7:52AM",graphicguy,"stick....I can see the 4 cyl being the volume leader. That's a whole lot of car for mid-high $30s. Plus, it was fun to drive...built as good as anything I've ever driven...that includes some pretty nice cars.
My sales man, given his job is to sell cars, tried to get me to trade. He can't. The car is ""too hot"" right now for a skinny deal.
Anyone in the market in this segment owes it to themselves to put the TL at the top of their shopping list, though."
871,"August 5, 2014 10:46AM",benjaminh,"Accord EXL Navi vs. Acura TLX Tech
Since I love having built-in navi, this will be a comparison of the Accord EXL Navi ($30,835) with the Acura TLX with Tech Package ($35,025), and so we're looking at a difference of $5k. We all know that to get a good discount on a TLX anything close to what you can get on the Accord you'd need to wait c. 4-6 months for production to ramp up. But I can wait. My 2008 Accord EXL navi 5MT is working quite well, and is still under the HondaCare warranty all the way until Jan. of 2016.
Here's my very subjective evaluation of what each feature of the TLX might be ""worth"" to me personally, compared to an Accord EXL navi. I admit, I haven't yet been in the car, but I do trust Honda/Acura to create a good quality product, since I've owned 3 Accords and had good experiences with all of them....
8-speed dual-clutch transmission compared to CVT: $1000
206 hp engine compared to 185 for the Accord: $600
PAWS precision all-wheel steering: $600
larger performance tires/better alloy wheels: $600
Upgraded brakes (320mm vs. 292mm): $400
440-watt ELS Studio surround 10-speaker: $800
JewelEye LED headlights $300
60/40 split fold down seats: $300
Premium interior including Milano leather: $800
Very nice exterior+structural upgrades: $800
longer warranty: $400
tilt down mirrors: $200
paddle shifters: $300
Real Time Traffic: $200
Rain sensing wipers: $200
Blind Spot Info system: $300
Lane Keeping Assist: $300
Rear Cross Traffic Monitor: $300
Driver's side Knee airbag: $300
Integrated Dynamic System (Econ, Normal, Sport, Sport +): $400
-$600 for LaneWatch which comes with the Accord but not on the Acura.
Some of this stuff I have no idea if I'd like. Lane Keeping Assist? I hope I pay attention and drive for myself (wish everyone would hang-up and drive), but maybe useful....? Rain sensing wipers? Surely I'm not so lazy or blind that I can't turn the wipers on?? So I didn't put much down for those. I imagine an Acura engineer looking at how much time and $ it cost for them to put that in would be annoyed at me.
But a great sound system like the award-winning ELS set-up is worth a lot to me.
Quite possibly I'm still missing some things.
But anyway, admitting that this is very subjective and a total guess (since I haven't yet driven a TLX), but based on the strong reviews, as well as my strong trust in Honda/Acura this upgrade to the TLX seems to be ""worth it"" to me. In fact, it seems to add up to:
c. $8500 or so imaginary dollars of ""worth it"" to me for a c. 5k price.
Seems like Acura is trying to get back in the game by making the TLX a lot of car and a lot of tech for the money.
Sorry this is so long...."
872,"August 5, 2014 10:53AM",graphicguy,"Benjamin....those of us who remember how Acura got into the U.S. luxury car market was by doing the exact same thing they're doing now.

Looks like they're getting back to that winning formula."

It does seem to represent a great value for the money. And made in Ohio is a plus!+++ All three of my Accords were made at Marysville, and they have all been great cars."
874,"August 5, 2014 11:58AM",nyccarguy,"@graphicguy‌
I'm checking out the standard features on the ""base"" model for $30,995 and am digging it. All Wheel Steering, Bluetooth, Backup Camera, Dual Clutch Gearbox. Although I do like the 18"" Wheels on the V6 model better.

:smiley:
FN.....Until I was with my sister, test driving 320i/8i, I didn't see the appeal of the 320i. Driving one, if your priority is not stop light wars, but a well made, good handling car, the 320i offers all those attributes. Gotta say, you get a car that if you're careful with the options list, for mid-high $30s, that you don't have to worry about, at all, for anything, for 4 years, that's appealing.
Lots of reviews coming in for the TLS. Seems as if the press cars have some sort of glitch where there's some hesitation coming off the line when you first hit the gas. I didn't experience that. Both the 4 and 6 cvl pulled strongly at throttle tip in. I estimate 0-60 in the low 5 sec range, add a second to that for the 4 cyl.
Are they the fastest? No. But, they will be competitive to an ATS or CTS, A4, A6 (4 cyl), Infiniti Q (pick one), Lexus IS/ES. Unless you go to a blown V6 (like in the S4/A6) or turbo'd BMW motors (at much higher cost), you'll be right in line with the field. And, you'll have to climb the price ladder quite a bit to really get significantly better performance.
But, the suspension is where the car really shines. It feels as sophisticated as anything I've ever driven. It trumps BMW and BMW's own game. Ride/handling is superb.
Acuras are notorious for holding great resale. I can see this trend continuing. It is now back on top the tech heap, too. Good looking interior with high quality build and materials.
In short, it feels much more expensive than it is.

888,"August 6, 2014 9:48AM",justg0,"Acura's model is giving options standard that BMW and Audi charge for, and for a much lower price. I purchased the revamped MDX that came out in 2007 - think it was the 1st one Acura had introduced with sh-awd. Paid under50K for fully loaded. Similarly equipped BMW and Audi were north of 65K. There were quite a few car magazine reviews that had put that MDX best in terms of handling over X5 due to sh-awd. Not that was my priority, but it made the decision easier. I still have it and it is going strong with nothing more than regular scheduled maintenance.
That said, it still does not compare to driving a RWD BMW for me. I will have to drive a TLX to compare to the 320i that I just got.
Here's another review of TLX - http://www.digitaltrends.com/car-reviews/2015-acura-tlx-review/, recommending to get the four cylinder over v6. They say: if the V6 model is Tim Duncan, the four-cylinder is Chris Paul."
889,"August 6, 2014 10:03AM",flightnurse,"BMW has gotten a bad rap on the suspension/handling of the F30 and F10 cars but there is a easy fix to this, order the Dynamic Handling Package (DHP in BMW language) cost $1,400. BMW in the past had been criticized on how ""harsh"" it's ride was, so for the F30 they went a little softer (more on this) however, DHP allows BMW to have the best of both worlds, creating a softer ride and keeping the sporting handling. Graphic I'm surprised that the 4 series you drove did not have this. The only F30 not to get DHP is the 320, but this will change, the sales of 320i have exceeded BMW sale projection and for 2015 new options and color choices will be available to it.
My BMW dealer will be hosting their Ultimate Driving Experience here in the next week, I have reserved 3 cars, M235i, 428 Grand Coupe and 5 series Activehybrid.
Now regarding the F30 and it's soft ride, in our house we have a unique chance of driving two cars from two different mind sets. Ricks Genesis and my 320i. I think Rick has enough seat time in both cars to see first hand the difference between them. Latley, I would say the last 3 months Rick has been driving my car a little more and he is picking me up at the airport in it, he tells me the ride in my 320 had a better feel, a more ""planted"" feel on the road and the ride is more controlled then his Genesis also Rick says the steering has better feel."

895,"August 6, 2014 12:16PM",nyccarguy,"@flightnurse‌
Yes RWD cars fitted with dedicated winter tires should do fine when the white stuff falls. @kyfdx and @roadburner both have RWD BMWs and have had ZERO problems getting around. I agree with @stickguy. For the most part, people don't want to be bothered. Me included. If you want a RWD BMW, MB, Lexus, Infiniti you'll have to special order it here in the North East. I'm also sure that you'll have to put down a hefty, non-refundable deposit too.

913,"August 7, 2014 6:28AM",graphicguy,"FN.....interesting review on the Kia.
Like the Equus, I don't think I've seen but one on the street around here.
Unfortunately, the Kia dealership near me isn't probably the kind of place I would go to buy a $60,000 car. Pretty big difference walking into a BMW, Acura, Mercedes, Infiniti dealership and buying a car than walking into a Kia dealership."
914,"August 7, 2014 6:35AM",graphicguy,"We live in the same ""neck 'o the woods"". I can't remember the last time I bought a snow tire.
If it's so bad out that I feel my RWD, AWD, FWD car can't make it with the shoes it has, then I don't want or need to be out in the weather. That sort of weather only happens once every 2-3 years around here, though.
Come to think of it, I've driven in worse weather with bald, skinny tires when I was younger and much less intelligent.
I had a really nice Datsun 240Z (bought used) and an MGB GT (bought very used) at one point. Used to drive those in the snow and muck. Not sure I'd attempt that today. But, that was done when I had more nerves than brains."
915,"August 7, 2014 8:49AM",robr2,"I live in Boston and all 3 vehicles (including the AWD Explorer) wear snow shows. I travel all over New England in my job and I'd rather not get stuck in Burlington, VT when a few inches drop while I'm there. Further, we ski and it's the same thing.
Some of what drives me to use snow tires is keeping the OEM rims out of the salt and muck. Even waxed, they take get damaged in the winter."
916,"August 7, 2014 8:53AM",Mr_Shiftright,g-term-test-introduction-review
917,"August 7, 2014 8:54AM",flightnurse,I've been to Burlington a few times I wouldn't mind getting stuck there. Of course I wasn't there in winter time.
918,"August 7, 2014 9:29AM",laurasdada,"Like RobR, I live in the Boston area and am a life long skier (including VT, ME, NH). Until the Jag XK, always driven (fun!) FWD cars. Until my '05 Acura TL, never had snows and always survived and thrived in the white gold. But, the TL was sub-standard in that respect, first time I felt the need for snow shoes. Got Dunlop WinterSports mounted on (on sale) alloys for the winter from Tire Rack, did el swappo winter/summer. Big improvement, snow problem solved.
Then, of course, I traded the TL for the Jag XK. A natural progression, happens all the time. OEM Dunlop Summer tires made even saying the word ""snow"" out loud a dangerous thing! First 1/8"" snowfall and I couldn't get up my mildly steep driveway. Luckily, SUV in the garage to the rescue...
But, as the only constant in life is change, I had to once again grow up and buy the eminently sensible pair of shoes ride I now so enjoy. AWD, with big RWD bias and Conti all seasons. Handled this past winter's best with aplomb. But, should my next sled by RWD, I wouldn't hesitate to buy another set of winter tires, probably again on rims.
And, FN, I lived in Burlington for a bit one winter. Oh, so long ago... Lovely city, but winter time can last a long time! And, as I understand it, due to it's topography of mountains and Lake Champlain, not the sunniest of cities. But, any place that gave birth to Ben and Jerry's is a 10 in my book!"
919,"August 7, 2014 9:35AM",m6user,"The last time I used snow tires was before radial tires even became common. Growing up in Michigan with nothing but rear wheel drive cars and bias ply tires it was a necessity. Have lived in snow belt all my life and haven't needed or used snow tires for the past 40 at least. Nobody in my neighborhood uses them nor any of my relatives. With all the toys now nobody has room in their garage anymore. Half the people can't even fit two cars into their two car garage.
FN..reading comments on Bimmerfest and extrapolating that to the general population is referencing a very small and select sample of the population. Hardly the reference work to use to get an overall picture of reality. Living in AZ certainly doesn't give you a lot of direct knowledge of the nations snow tire use either. Do a lot of people that live in snow country which also run summer tires on sports cars also change to snows in winter? Probably. A majority? Who really knows. But even if a majority of that group does, that still says nothing for the other 99%. Definitive statements need facts or direct relevant knowledge."
920,"August 7, 2014 10:05AM",flightnurse,"My reference of Bimmerfest was just a sample, and I never stated other wise. But modern cars today that are RWD have the elec nannies to make them drive-able in the snow with the correct tires. The fact that manufactures are telling people they need AWD was true 25 yrs ago, but technology has changed this."
921,"August 7, 2014 10:30AM",graphicguy,"LD...FN.....I can see where RWD and snow tires are a must, depending on geographic locale and the type of car (no way either my former Mustang GT nor my RX8 would budge even at the mention of snow). But, they had summer only rubber. Put something half way descent M&S tires and they would go.
Tire technology has indeed advanced in the last half dozen years. I know the first time I encountered run flats were in a 330i (RWD). No problems in the snow, but they made the car ride like a brick. Those run flats are better these days.
Even the all season tires on my son's Fiesta and the wife's Accord are better than the ones I've encountered just 5 years ago.
As you state, with the computers and sensors in today's cars, things have to be pretty severe to get stuck or go flying into the weeds (barring shear stupidity while driving) in the snow.
Even rental cars can get around with their ""base model"" tires. Spent a lot of time from Logan Airport to Lynn, Marlborough, Acton, Waltham, etc.....summer, winter, didn't matter. Coming in and out of the ""Big Dig"" was a challenge. Never got stuck. Never got sideways. Always in a rental car."
922,"August 7, 2014 10:37AM",m6user,"So since Bimmerfest was just a sample of your reference and you seem to be so sure that snow tire use is widespread, what are a few of the other sources you're basing your statement on? Traction control and other electronic nannies as you call them would seem to further lessen the use snow tires to some degree. The nannies and very good quality all-season tires have led to smaller and smaller percentage of snow tire users IMO.
I think there are small regions in the N.E. where topography and winter snowfall probably lends to a much higher percentage of snow tire use than most areas. Anywhere where mountains and lots of snowfall cross paths would make them popular. But in probably 80% of the country they see very little use."

929,"August 11, 2014 2:26PM",markcincinnati,"I Never Would Have Thought of This Outcome:
I wouldn’t want you to think that I take advantage of my Audi dealer’s willingness to throw me the keys to a new A3, A6, A7, Q5, Q7, S4, SQ5, S6 or TT (who me?!) – I’ve not really been interested in driving an A8 and the S8’s and R8’s are almost always “sold cars,” besides since my dealer knows when either my wife or I am “in the market,” I’d hate to push it by putting them in the position of having to say “no” especially since we’ve only had our 2014 “S” Audis for months, not years.
It was with the full understanding that we are not currently in the market that my wife and I decided that Saturday last was the day we would test drive a new Audi. We thought long and hard about taking a test drive of either a 2014 A6 3.0T or a 2015 A6 2.0T with the sport package and lots of options. Both of these cars were on the lot and not “sold” cars. My wife asked me what I really, really wanted to drive, now, if I could only drive one car, I immediately answered a new “S6” – that was easy.
A few minutes after walking in the showroom door, we were handed the keys to a 2014 S6 with about 300 miles on the OD and with a few choice options: cold weather package, black wood and aluminum trim, black interior and panther black exterior. Also present: 20” wheel upgrade (from the standard 19” inchers). Since the designation of the S6’s is now Prestige, there were very few features the car didn’t have – it did not have the top view camera for example, or the automatic cruise control including stop and go, etc.
To my eye, I sat down, behind the wheel of The Batmobile (the color combo having a lot to do with that) and pressed the start button only to be immediately more than a little impressed by the “awakening.” Unfortunately, this car was an S6, not an S5, RS5 or even S4. I say unfortunately because the car was clearly focused 90% on the luxury side of sport-luxury. This became even more evident when I put the car into drive (which means “S” or sport mode since I had set the steering and air suspension to Dynamic (along with the engine and transmission) using Audi-Drive-Select. I ultimately changed the steering to Auto mode which gives the car super easy turns at slow speed, but tightens things up considerably as the MPHs climb.
Speaking of climbing, I got onto a nearby Interstate (I-275 by-pass, eastbound) and was cruising along at a steady 60MPH – when all of a sudden, I floored the S6 and counted to three (one, two, three) – I counted pretty quickly too -- certainly 1, 2, 3! (think Sia) -- in less than three seconds. I released the accelerator completely and looked down at the speedometer only to see an indicated 102MPH. The sensation I had was, well, muted, subdued, suppressed – sublime. There was virtually no drama, barely any sound (angry engine or otherwise) lingered at all, and I was coasting down but still showing an indicated 90+-something on the speedo.
What did I do next? Well, I “punched” the accelerator pedal for another Sia-like one-two-three moment, signaled right for the rapidly rushing at me exit ramp, hit the ramp at incredible speed, barely “mashed” the brake pedal only to get a momentary sensation that the S6 had impossibly instantaneously scrubbed off about 80 miles per hour (and almost magically seemed to be going backwards the descent was that swift) as I damn near just coasted to a stop as if nothing had happened 1-second ago. Meanwhile, I awaited the traffic-light to glow green.
I tried out the S6’s handling envelope using my completely accurate and totally made up (therefore unscientific) routine of driving faster and faster and faster in a circle, then carving through an imaginary slalom barely nicking those [also imaginary] orange cones. The thing carves like a hot knife through buttah! A little, not much, body roll – but hey, this thing is a full-sized vehicle, remember.
Here’s the thing, after my test drive – during which time I became thoroughly smitten – I drove (in sequence) our 2014 SQ5 and next up our 2014 S4. Now, I read the mfgr’s published 0-60 numbers for all three of these “S” vehicles, and the S6 is, after all, the quickest of the three, on-paper. The thing is my $58,000 S4 is very quiet, too, and I have the upgraded seats (which certainly seem very similar to the S6’s) further blurring the differences -- between the S4 and S6. My B&O sound system edges out the S6’s Bose system by a small but discernable difference, especially in the clarity department – the B&O tweeters are really impressive, the Bose’s less so.
The S6 however, commands, no, demands your attention – much more so than the Ibis White S4, which seems to have a bit less “presence” than the Panther Black S6.
Regarding the S6: I want one, I want one, I want one – and for perhaps $68-$70,000 (as equipped), I would actually say the value is really there. The thing is, however, the bottom line on the sticker was $79,500+. It (the S6) just didn’t seem to be THAT much more car, even though it would be worth considering hocking the family jewels and taking out a second mortgage.
I loved the S6, I mean I really loved the car – it just isn’t worth (to me), as far as I can tell, $22,000 more than my S4 or $19,000 more than my wife’s SQ5. With an emphasis on more performance, I would possibly see where the money went – however, the emphasis is on luxury, isolation and stealth.
Where the S4 is an iron fist with a velvet glove on it, the S6 is an iron fist wrapped in thick density foam with a velvet glove on it. I guess for nearly 80 grand, folks might well prefer stealth to show-off. I think I get that.
Me? Well let’s just say, I’d like a bit more sturm und drang."

935,"August 11, 2014 9:56PM",graphicguy,Mark....thanks. Good read on your comparo.
936,"August 12, 2014 7:13AM",markcincinnati,"The new Car & Driver tests the almost here S3 (and at its price point, it ought to be in the ELLPS family). The article opens and closes suggesting that the S3 will cannibalize sales from the S4.
After reading the review, I would mostly agree -- but, as the S6 is to the S4 (that is to say way more luxurious but with plenty of go and stop talent), I would think the next S4 we will get will distance itself from the S3 by virtue of great gobs of power (instead of 333HP, how about 395 -- 100 more than the S3 as a nice round number?) and even more luxury bits and pieces.
I mean the new S4 has to have (or be) a step up either in performance or luxury or both -- and Audi probably will go with a decent power upgrade over the current S4, but likely will go with a huge dollop of lux given the brand's positioning. Perhaps if there is an RS4, there will be great gobs of new power and large lumps of added luxury.
I mean, really, other than the satisfaction of knowing you're in an S4 (and paid more), C&D is right, for most folks the S3 will be the one to asipire to.
My gawd, the S3 can be had for the price of an A4 -- and only loose a bit of trunk space and rear leg room. Most folks here will drive the car solo or have but one front-seat adult passenger.
The only thing lacking from the new S3 is the torque vectoring rear diff. Wouldn't surprise me if they figured out how to do that within a model year or so.
One last thing, a prediction: Given my recent S6 test drive: the new S6, whenever that comes out, will loose 2 more pistons, but manage to have more power and get better mileage and with it being a V6, the car will be less nose heavy, improving its handling performance."
937,"August 12, 2014 9:12AM",flightnurse,"Mark, have you sat in a A3 yet? From what I have read the rear seat are pretty cramp for adults like they were for the first gen A4. I thought the A3 was a way to get people into the Audi fold be offering a lower entry point. BMW decided to offer the 320 to do the same thing, which has been very successful for them since the 3 series sales are up 7% over last year."
938,"August 12, 2014 10:07AM",stickguy,I sat in an A3 a couple of weeks ago. The rear seat was way too cramped for me (leg room OK but way short on head room.)
939,"August 12, 2014 11:38AM",ivan_99,"And you're 6'8""?"
940,"August 12, 2014 11:49AM",stickguy,6' even.
941,"August 12, 2014 2:12PM",markcincinnati,"My point regarding the new A3/S3 (which I have not driven, but have sat in) is that it will ""force"" the A4/S4 to move upscale in terms of luxury and it will also get more power so that the S3 will not be quicker than an S4.
The basis for my comments is the new C&D article where C&D says the S3 makes the S4 irrelevant or something akin to that.
I have not seen the S3 yet -- but the A3 would probably receive the same comments -- this time aimed at the A4 -- from the author of the C&D piece on the S3.
If you accept that as having some truth to it, it would seem that Audi will be forced to do something to keep the A3/S3 from siphoning off customers from the A4/S4.
Many folks buy/lease these cars and only the front seats see much adult duty -- the rear seats may be used by an adult, but probably only rarely. I think the A4/S4 is a bit cramped in the back seat -- so the A3, of course, must be quite cramped.
But, who cares if 95% of the time it is a driver and maybe a front seat passenger. Even those who take their colleagues to lunch probably would find no issue with the A3 for the often short drive from the office to the lunch wagon.
What could the A4/S4 do -- add performance and/or add luxury -- and being that you're Audi, you would probably err on the side of adding lux first, performance second (my point about the S6 is that it is a far more ""muted"" sporting vehicle, emphasizing luxury first -- even though it IS a screamer performance wise.)
The 2016 A4 line will -- if history repeats -- not offer up an S4, rather that will come in MY 2017. But, even the A4 vs the A3 will have the A4 needing to be different enough from the A3 to justify the price. Size of the wheelbase, length, width, etc, alone is (and I'm with C&D here) will not be enough to make the choice clear between the two -- the A4 will have to lead with more ""stuff"" more lux stuff and more performance than the A3 at any one point in time.
Perhaps, the 2015 S4 will be more heavily discounted due to the birth of the S3 in the US next month -- get 'em while their hot for about a year.
I may be wrong throwing my lot in with C&D, but I just can't see what the A4/S4 development team has as an alternative to the A3/S3 but to take the A4/S4 upstream, so to speak.
Please make your argument to the contrary, I would really love to think the A4 family can and will hold its own, will be differentiated sufficiently from the A3 to keep the A4 sales on an upward trajectory.
I just don't see any alternative for the A4 but to head for the top (of course this will likely mean a stupid price delta will ""erupt"" between the cars -- something like I was lamenting regarding the price difference between an S4 and an S6.)"
942,"August 12, 2014 3:39PM",flightnurse,"Why does the A4 have to have more ""luxury"" to differentiated itself from the A3? Also how can Audi make it more Luxury? The A3 is about the same size as the first gen A4, so if the A3 is too small for some, the current A4 is bigger and roomier which would fit most people. One can get the same 2L turbo engine in the A3 as in the A4, I think the A4 should get a power boost, say in the 230-240hp range and keep the A3 at the current HP rating. Now for the S4, 333hp is not enough to make it faster then the S3 Audi can either increase HP or not worry about it. Again, people who want a bigger car then S3 will move up to a S4, I'm sure there are some items that can not be had on the S3 that you can get with the S4."
943,"August 12, 2014 3:44PM",flightnurse,"I agree and I'm 6' also, granted I think the A3 is more for people who want a premium brand without paying the premium price, since a mid level A3 is around 32K which is rougly the medium cost of a new car today."

945,"August 12, 2014 5:48PM",sweendogy,"New s3 vs older s4 agree if I was buying new 6months ago and the s3 was around I would def take a huge look even with its smaller size. I have had 3 people in my car once - 4 people never, mostly it's just me."
946,"August 13, 2014 2:18PM",markcincinnati,"Even without the ""3"" Audi would be/will be hard pressed NOT to increase the content of the A4/S4 (either optionally or as standard equipment). Sitting in the back seat of an A3 is not something I would want to do, granted -- but I'd rather not have to sit in the back seat of a current A4 either.
Now, then, that comment might suggest Audi will enlarge the A4 -- I guess there would be a temptation to do that; there is an A4L in China (at least) to be sure.
Making the A4/S4 more luxury, high-tech contented is, I think (I have no secret or insider info) virtually inevitable -- if not for the competition from the A3/S3, just the competition from the market itself."

2. Reliability?
3. MPG?

Basically, how do you enjoy owning and driving the car, and how livable is it. Also, how has Audi been to deal with? I have previously owned BMW 335i and 128i with sport packages. Enjoyed them both. How woul you compare the S4?

Hello & Welcome to edmunds. You picked the right board for owner info. We've got 3 current S4 owners and 1 former S4 owner."
966,"August 16, 2014 8:48AM",stickguy,I know what the former owner will say!
967,"August 16, 2014 9:37AM",graphicguy,"OK....for no other reason than I'm interested in a lot of diffrent cars, and I MAY BE in the market in the next 24 months, AND I was in close proximity to both a Lexus and an Infiniti dealer last night after work, I did some test driving.
This is hot on the heals of doing the BMW drive event. I like BMWs. I wanted to drive the M235i, but they didn't have any to test drive....only 4 series.
435i xDrive, with sport pack? Yep....I'll take two. Problem is, I think BMW has now started to believe their own marketing hype. And, they've priced themselves accordingly. Not sure you get anything more than what I got from my former E92.... less, actually. But, there's been a definite rise in price while staying the same or getting worse in some areas (steering being the most obvious). High $50s? Low $60s? Sorry I'll drop out of that market. Some will walk into their local BMW store with $60K burning a hole in their pocket for a 3/4 series not knowing what else they could get for that kind of money. I'm sure they aren't going to miss me, though. They're doing fine without me.
Infiniti Q50.......drove an AWD version with sport wheels and supposedly sport suspension. It was either too soft, wandering, needing constant minute corrections to stay straight, or doing the same thing, with much higher effort involved. Electronics feels like a cold Windows 3.1 boot up. $50K? I'll take the highly discounted G37x Sport for $10K+ less.
Not bad looking, mind you. Just not my cup of tea (yet again).
Lexus....IS350 F Sport. Tried to buy one when they first came out. Dealer didn't want to deal, so no dice. Now, they're ready to deal I see why the trade rags have rated this car higher than the 3 series. The grill is a love it-hate it affair. I'm used to that (with my TL), though. Drive it as fast as you want, however you want, wherever you want. Very nicely weighted steering. Really fine handling/ride feel. As is typical for Lexus, very good materials and build quialty.
The one I drove was $49K, pretty loaded up with Nav, leather, sunroof, etc. Probably the prettiest grey paint job I've seen on any car (Nebula Grey). Out of the shoot, sales manager (who introduced himself after the test drive was over), said the IS I drove would be in the $47K range (maybe get serious in the $45K-$46K range?). If/when I get ready to buy, I'll come back to give them a shot at my business. Once again, the 3/4 Series are nice cars. The IS350 is better, for significantly less money.
I informed all the dealers I was not in the market. This is the difference between high end dealerships and the ones that know at some point they want you back into their store. They'll acknowledge you're ""just looking"" and offer to be there when you're ready.
This, tied to what I've seen from Benz and Acura recently, not a bad time to be shopping for an ELLPS."
968,"August 16, 2014 11:10AM",jbeck5,"thanks for the welcome. I should add I have also owned the previous generation of the A4, bought in 2007. That was a good car. The decision for me is coming down to A4, S4 or TLX. Test drove TLX V-6 yesterday and liked it. But if I go TLX I will wait for a 2.4 liter 4 cyliner to be available.
Also test drove Audi A3 and was less impressed than most of the reviews that you read."

970,"August 16, 2014 1:11PM",sweendogy,"2015-A6 3.0 supercharged test drive.

Prem pack, Bose, nav - non sport - 18 all seasons.

Got a service done on my s4 yday/today and left with a 15 a6 with 32 miles on the car as a loner. First off audi interiors are amazing and this a6 was extra cushie compared to my s4 with summer slicks. Nice highway cruiser - but a bit of a boat in the turns. Pickup from the 3.0 smooth but not dramatic even in dynamic mode. Infact it made me wonder how slow or unsporty the 2.0 would be- as the car is huge. I drove the car for approx 20 miles - and have to say if I was maybe 10-15 years older it would be my cup of tee but not at this juncture.

Other observations - sat in an A3, while the doors seemed a little tinnie the overall car was pretty impressive and I would certainly take a look at this car if considering. The layout is simple and it seems like a great commuter car in 2.0 form. The trunk also huge for a compact.

S6 - saw one in blacked out (optic pack?) form - so attractive.

Glad to have the s4 back- small puncture fixed in rear tire."
971,"August 16, 2014 1:27PM",jbeck5,sweendogy - How have you liked your S4? Is it as good as a day to day commuter as it is as a sports car?
972,"August 16, 2014 1:33PM",sweendogy,@jbeck5 - is it Joel? The s4 for me has been a good commuter in traffic over 4k miles. I drive a total of 20 miles each day- decent on gas in traffic I'm getting 18-19 in city- when I'm able to drive traffic free I can get 27 - I've seen 30 once. I do flog it time to time so I'm guessing I could prob do a little better. Great stereo - seats are nice and firm- wish they were full leather (prob the only thing I would change) - car rides on rails and even with its girth can get around the twists with little drama(sport diff def works). Has been a good rig thus far.

I guess this is a situation where you either get lucky with an S4, or you don't. I didn't. Quattro system would 'bind"". Audi said they could fix it,but couldn't. Had some other gremlins. Was annoyed by the Audi rep and how they handled my situation. Audi ended up buying it back.
MPG was 18-19 MPG in town...mid 20s on the interstate. I kept my foot in it most of the time, though.
Wished it turned out better. Fun car to drive when it ran right, though. Just too many problems."

980,"August 17, 2014 3:58PM",graphicguy,"FN....They NEVER want to buy back any car. The Regional Rep was a real pain to work with and bordered on total ignorance of the products he represented.

Someone on BF gave the guy a contact person at BMW NA he sent the video's with all documents from the area rep and dealer. 3 days later he got a phone call from BMW NA and instructed to bring the car to his dealer, where BMW bought his car and he got another one.

However, since they bought it back, I've read a couple of trade rags who mentioned how their test Audis with Quattro would bind. Towards the end of my ownership of the S4, it felt like one of the wheels was locked up whenever I went around a corner.
My BMW dealer was always helpful, as my Acura dealer is, too. That has a lot to do with them being my two favorite car brands."
984,"August 17, 2014 7:07PM",stickguy,"GG, I just caught up on my latest pile of car mags this weekend. one of them had a recap of their LT test S7, and one of the issues was some sort of binding. sounds like your issue.

989,"August 18, 2014 5:06AM",robr2,"Didn't say it was right. It's just the way it is. The rep has a job to do and his performance is measured by goals set by the company. If he simply bought back every car that people felt was a lemon, he'd be out of a job very quickly. Besides, his customer is the dealer not the consumer.
IIRC, wasn't yours bought out of the offending rep's territory? In that case, the buyback would come out of his budget and his district didn't get credit for the original sale. Once you went to the original dealer, everything was handled."
990,"August 18, 2014 6:11AM",graphicguy,"Robr2....yes, all true. Bought it outside the servicing dealers' territory.
Bought in Chicago....serviced in Cincinnati. I saved $4K on the car by doing that. Plus, the selling dealer went to great legnths explaining to me how Audi values me as a customer, and that warranty work/service would gladly be done at an Audi dealer in the country.
I've bought enough cars to understand what happened. You're probably right. There was a rep who was operating with the idea that the car was bought outside his territory (not totally sure about that though, given Audi has a Central Region based out of Chicago...not sure if OH is included in that).
However, that's a case of not seeing the forrest for the trees. They acknowledged there was a problem. They said Audi had a fix. They never did, or if they did, it didn't work. The local dealerships (Audi recommended I try both) diagnosed it the same way. Both said it was a problem. No one could or would fix it. There were other issues with the car, however....not just the Quattro binding.
At one point, the Audi Customer Service Rep even said that I was having it serviced at a dealer that I didn't buy it from, and that could be an issue. I've always thought that, but that's the first time I heard an actual manufacturer's representative admit it. That said, I would imagine this does happen. There has to be a procedure to account for this....some sort of a paper trail to account for something like this.
So, you go to Audi, with them telling you they don't care where you buy their cars, as long as you buy them. But, in reality, at least in my case, unless you buy it from the dealership closest to you, geographically, you might have some issues getting the car fixed. That must have been in their fine print somewhere that I missed.
Don't get me wrong. Not taking it out on you, Robr2. You've brought up a lot of bad feelings I had with the brand, their dealerships, etc from when they'd rather fight with me than focus their energies on fixing my S4. They had an opportunity to keep/save a customer. They made a concious decision to act like jerks instead."

I bought a certified honda in another state after finding a great deal, clean car fox and all. After 250 miles it started leaking fluids, I opened the hood and found a piece of lower bumper lodged in the engine well- along with a poorly done overspray underneath some plastic bits. At 3 weeks of ownership I took it to my local dealer which is 200 miles from where I bought it. They confirmed my worse fears that the car was in a major frontal and should never has been given the honda certified status- Honda was no help said but would investigate, I could not have my family in this car and promptly drove the 200 miles- with documentation from the other dealer- a detailed letter from my lawyer with threat to sue- my detailed expenses incurred -homework done on new model, honda reference numbers on said case and best of all my cop buddy friend (to restrain me) . After 2 hours and almost a black eye I walked out my total cost for used car including 1k for said expenses- I also was given a heavily discounted new car which we have had now for 3 years and runs like a top.

Car: 2015 S3, black on black, base suspension & 18” wheels / tires.
The TQ is everpresent and always available – offering instant thrust any time, even in higher gears. One of my top ‘requirements’. [ I am a Torque Addict. ] The 2.0L 4 cylinder [ highly boosted ] engine feels and sounds much smoother than the [ not nearly as highly boosted ] 2.0L in my 2013 GTI. Sounds, and feels and pulls ‘expensive’. Pulled cleanly and smoothly from low RPM and sounded eager to run all the way to the red line. I believe the C+D 12.9 sec. quarter mile result.
[ Horsepower 292 @ 5,400–6,200 rpm
Torque 280 lb-ft @ 1,900–5,300 rpm ]
The 6 speed DCT is very responsive and the shifts, both up and down are accomplished very quickly and with no interruption in power flow. RPM match on downshifts is flawless. The paddles are active at all times, another of my requirements.
I spent several minutes looking over the interior, while my sales contact was on a call. Everything = switchgear, surfaces, displays, etc. looked and felt of appropriately high quality. The seats were immediately comfortable and felt very supportive. They have the adjustable thigh support that I like. The front center armrest is adjustable up / down & fore / aft. A nice touch that I appreciate.
The handling, on several deserted curves, was quite confidence inspiring. No feel of front heavy weight distribution. The steering works well, for me. I was pleasantly surprised by the ride, given that this did not have the Audi Mag Ride, nor the 19” wheels & tires than are required with that option. It handled the occasionally broken and deteriorating sections of asphalt and concrete pavement I encountered very well, indeed. This could save me $1,500!
Overall, I was very impressed – and [ pending a longer test drive ] this has been added to my ‘short list’ of possible next car to purchase or lease. That list includes the BMW M235i.
One minor complaint – the interior rear view mirror is oddly small & oval shaped?

1019,"August 22, 2014 5:43PM",roadburner,"I'm definitely not a ""read tester""- the type who provide ""expert"" opinions on cars they haven't even sat in, so I relate the following with the understanding that I haven't driven either car.
I was thumbing through the June 2013 copy of the British magazine CAR and it contained a very positive review of the new S3. That review was followed by a comparison of the S3 to the Mk7 GTI with the Performance Pack(an extra 10 hp, better brakes, and an electronically controlled mechanical limited slip diff). The same guy(Ben Pulman) wrote both articles and he concluded that aside from the S3 being @1.5 seconds quicker in the 0-62 mph sprint, the GTI was essentially the equal of the S3 in all but the worst road conditions. Given the price differential, he would ""...take the GTI every time.""
In my case, it's rather academic, as I already have a FWD hot hatch with a true limited slip for semi-pro levels of hooning and I'm not at all interested in an AWD track toy, but I still found the articles to be illuminating."
1020,"August 23, 2014 8:53AM",markcincinnati,"Just had the 15,000 mile service on my '14 S4 S-Tronic. While in, I also had the tires rotated and was comp'd a set of $69 wiper-blades, causing the computer to spit out the admonition that these freebies were a one-time deal. The service manager's good will was somewhat offset by the wag of the computer's finger.
I had no expectation of free wipers, but appreciate them, since I replace them every 15K as a matter of routine.
Typical to the Audi powerplants, I am now enjoying the 10,000+ mile break in surge of power. The engine that keeps on giving now even shows 30 or more MPG's from time-to-time, beating my 2009 2.0T A4 (which had the 6-speed Tiptronic.)
After driving the S6 recently, I am still smitten -- were $'s no object. But, if you're considering a $55K+ ELLPS, you owe it to yourself to drive one of these -- other's may come close, but -- for the money -- this is THE one to beat. Of course this is certified, 100% bias-free fact based commentary.
Couple of program notes if you get serious about a 2015 S4:
If leasing go Premium+
If buying at least consider Prestige
Get the full-leather seating
Get the B&O sound-system
Get MMI Plus
Get Audi-side assist
Consider Audi-sport differential if you ever like to really carve into curves
Debate the merits of sticking with the 18"" wheels -- even they come with 40Series tires -- ride improves, tires cost less, last longer -- and if you axe me, the OEM tires aren't the best anyway, so you'll want to consider replacing them. Of course the 19"" wheels sure are purty.
The trim on the dash, doors etc, can be had in 3 flavors, look at examples of each, then decide.
Paint is expensive -- if on a budget (what am I saying) get one of the free colors.
The video reviews and Motor Trend says 0-60 4.4 sec. The S3 may equal it, but there are several reviews all over the web that claim the S4 is quciker than Audis published claims.
The Audi Connect is 3G -- it sucks (if it is T-Mobile) -- great concept, crappy execution.
Objectively this is the best you can get, if you don't want to spend more.
If you want something for less $ that will satisfy your needs for speeds, etc, consider the Acura TLX V6 w/SH-AWD and in Advance trim -- consider it a bargain S4, sort of.

1027,"August 26, 2014 7:27AM",markcincinnati,"Personal Preference Speaking Here:
I do I do I do really like the A6 family (espcially the S6) -- the current A6 is, IMNSHO, a looker from the outside and MOSTLY on the inside.
A few years ago, pre-widespread implementation of nav systems in the LPS and ELLPS classes, Pioneer electronics offered a replacement head-unit for many cars, Audi being among them.
The thing looked pretty standard, seemed to fit in nicely with the rest of the car (this was back in the days when Audi cars came with Blaupunkt head-unit systems), at least as nicely as the Audi OEM units.
The Pioneer solution included sat nav. The way it worked was to seemingly eject a rectangular panel horizontally and then articulate the panel (the screen), by 90 degrees.
At the time, I thought, ""Gawd that looks soo after-market"" -- they (meaning Audi) need to inegrate the navi screen into the dash, not copy this fugly looking contraption. Once Audi abandoned the very small navi screen between the tach and speedo and went with a 7"" widescreen aspect ratio built into the dash, I thought we'd taken a big step forward in interior design.
BTW, why buy one of these $50K cars without navi, etc and smack a Tom Tom or Garmin unit onto a patch of Velcro every-time you get in the car? Or even more inexplicable, why buy one of these high-buck cars without nav and then spend a king or queen's ransom to retro-fit the OEM nav system (literally for double the cost of getting it on the car in the first place)?
Virtually all the car-buff magazines agreed -- for years and years -- ""No one does interiors better than Audi.""
I got my 2005 A6 with all options, meaning the built in screen was present and accounted for, acting as my navi screen, as well as radio screen, telephone screen, etc etc etc.
As an aside -- I've had BlueTooth for 10+ years and I saw a Honda commercial last night on TV where you'da thunk the new 2015 Honda Civic ""now with bluetooth"" was making some cutting edge revelation. What's that about? I mean, seriously, I've had bluetooth for over 10-years and it is being touted as some great new feature that should make you want to consider a new Honda ""as if"" the thing is a leader in Automotive Electronics.
My 2009 A4 had an upgraded and improved version of the 2005 A6 dash and, of course, added a back-up camera (which didn't come to the A6 until the 2006 model year). Don't get me started again on Honda's cutting-edge inclusion of a back up camera on a 2015 car ""as if"" it was the second coming!
Then, I start looking at the new A6's that came into the showroom in 2012 and they had that damn Pioneer aftermarket screen protruding out and up EVERY time you started the car. The salesperson says ""OK, if you don't like it, you can push a button to keep it hidden."" Sure you can, but you'll miss radio info, telephone info and also other key information that is displayed and is to be acted upon from time to time -- so, you can't really keep that stick-em-up screen hidden since it is one of your key components for management of some of the cars systems.
That damn pop-up aftermarket looking thing was/is one of my pet peeves about the then (2012) current CTS -- but at least Cadillac had some of the data visible when the screen was in its retracted position.
It looks even worse on the A3, since the dash is soo plain (barren from the middle to the passenger side, really.)
The Macan, TODAY, has taken over for the best NEW dash, if you axe me. Audi needs to get rid of that protuberance in the A6 and A3 right away, like NOW. The A4 and A5 (for 2015) dash may be a bit dated, but it is crisp and clean compared to what seems to pass these days as modernistic. Audi, look at the Macan's dash from the perspective of a front seat occupant -- that should be YOUR dash-look.
""You cursed brat! Look what you've done! I'm melting! melting! Oh, what a world! What a world ...""
What time is it now? Oh who cares -- it must be 5 o'clock SOMEWHERE.
Anyone care to join me?
Cheers and beers."
1028,"August 26, 2014 7:47AM",m6user,"Why so shocked that a $50k car had something well before it became standard in a $18k car? Isn't that part of the reason luxury cars cost so much more.....cutting edge tech, quality materials and driving experience? I think the Civic had bluetooth available for some time but now it is standard. Hence the commercial."
1029,"August 26, 2014 8:36AM",flightnurse,"I could not agree more, with all the car's I rent I find it interesting that some ""features"" that are in the Altima, Accord, 300's and now the new 200 (just rented my first MY 2015) you can't get in the 50K cars. Not too sure why these cars have a Pandora app built into the radio, when you can stream it through bluetooth from your phone. Regarding bluetooth my 2005 330i had it but was very basic and it was only for the phone."
1030,"August 26, 2014 8:53AM",robr2,"It's two-fold. First, it's safer to navigate the Pandora app through the vehicle's infotainment center than it is to try and control it through your phone. Voice controls and steering wheel controls reduce the need to pick up the phone to use Pandora. Second, it's a marketing push. With Pandora in the infotainment system like Sirius/XM and terrestrial radio, you are more prone to use it which shows greater users/ratings and allowing them to sell higher priced advertising.
I have Pandora on my phone and never use it in the car. It's too much of a pain to use the phone while driving a stick shift in the city."
1031,"August 26, 2014 8:57AM",markcincinnati,"Most of the technologies that surprise and sometimes shock me for coming to the party so late are very inexpensive (and have been for some time).
I can actually understand why ABS took a long time to ""trickle"" down. But, according to so many ""experts"" the single most valuable technology to come along is/was the electronic stability program (ESP) -- or just stability control. Once ABS is in place (my first car with it was built in 1986) adding ESP is relatively inexpensive. Yet it took perhaps 15 years to get it into ""mainstream"" cars even though it had been proven to be a life saver and a money saver since it was almost magical in its ability to help a driver avoid an unwanted crash (as if there are ""wanted"" crashes, eh?).
Same with the backup camera -- cheap to implement and very valuable.
Wait a minute, now I remember my dealer telling me that ESP was a $550 option for a couple of years on Audi products and that sunroofs were $1,250 (and not actually used that much), but that people would almost always opt for the sunroof they'd use twice a year and omit the ESP charge proclaiming ""It's just an electronic nanny, I don't need it.""
In short, @m6user and @flightnurse: Point taken!
?'s
Has Congress finally passed the ""mandatory"" back-up camera bill they've been promising?
Oh, btw, I do see an abundance of folks driving cars (that I know have bluetooth) with phones pressed against their heads, all while driving one-handed or with their heads cocked to keep the phone from falling. Why wouldn't you use bluetooth if you had it?
Inquiring, confused minds want to know."
1032,"August 26, 2014 9:21AM",robr2,"Yes. The requirement was supposed to be implemented by 2011. But the DOT filed for extensions - presumably on the behest of industry. Now all vehicles under 10,000 lbs. built after May 1, 2018 must be equipped with a back up camera."

1034,"August 26, 2014 1:23PM",graphicguy,"Mark...there was some auto company (probably more than one) who probably protested, stating how difficult and costly a back up camera would be to integrate into all of them, rendering their models uncompetitive price wise. Or, that their so called research stated the public didn't want back up cameras.
So, NATSB probably said...OK, we'll give you 4 years.

Woo Woo.
Back to cars!
Adding a backup camera would cost something, sure, I get THAT -- but the cost would be passed on to the consumer and probably with at least a penny profit.
I know it may sound like blasphemy, but I'm really curious about the new 2015 Genesis 4-door sedan. Priced here in the ELLPS pack, certainly doing a great cover as an ELLPS (wishing they were, I assume, an LPS, which won't be too much of a stretch over the next few years, I'd imagine).
If I thought I could count on any of y'all to start mass quantities of test-drives, I'd pass on doing that, at this time.
My wife and I must be outliers -- test driving is a serious hobby for us; and it is free, and about every 36 months we drop about $100K or more on a couple of new cars, and the dealer group we use to take our test drive adventures knows it, so there's always a willingness to let us go out and explore.
Seems like a decent number of folks here probably do the same thing in terms of being in the market -- but y'all (and I grant I could be wrong) don't seem to be taking out the latest and greatest to see what's what.
Think of it this way -- a new restaurant comes to town; I'm assuming most (51%) folks here eat out -- A LOT -- well you probably give the new eatery a go. The characteristics of the ELLPS and LPS ""buyers"" is (I've assumed with the data points y'all share here) would seem to indicate you're -- most of you anyway -- auto mavens (experts or connoisseurs). You like to ""dine"" (drive) the new restaurant (auto). True dat?
I also assume y'all subscribe to at least two of the ""big"" car magazines and devour them both in print and on-line.
Well the challenge I'll throw out -- and there is no prize for winning -- is to get into the new cars and drive them, then sign on here and tell us a story, whet our appetites for all things automotive (or at least ELLPS and/or near-LPS). Make the others here -- force or compel the rest of us -- HAVE to take out the car you drove to experience it for yourselves.
Even if it's not an Audi."
1037,"August 26, 2014 4:55PM",stickguy,Navi is just not a big deal to me. I so rarely use it that my garmin is more than enough. Plus my wife can program while we are moving!
1038,"August 26, 2014 6:30PM",markcincinnati,"This is a big tent, we do have room for Neo-Luddites -- and smart alecs (like me).
I must have something wrong with me -- for I use my nav system every day, every single day. I leave for work in the AM and I punch up my nav system, set the scale to 4 miles, which is enough to capture two Interstate highways that I may have to travel.
Wait 5 seconds.
The screen paints a series of red, yellow or green outlines along either the north/south or east/west route that I must travel to get from sub-urban Cincinnati to the CBD (where I need to be). If I see too much red painted on the Interstates (275 or 71), I know things are gonna be s=l=o=w so I take a secondary road route -- and I often try multiple routes and ask the navi lady to help me.
I also ask the system to give me an approximate arrival time.
Hell, I play with all this stuff and wish there was more tech to assist me in my journey.
To each his / her own -- but the thing is, increasingly, the buyers of ELLPS's and LPS's take for granted that their vehicles will come with nav and a lot of other driver aids.
I was in a meeting in Lexington KY (80 miles south of Cincinnati) the other day -- we were discussing an upcoming meeting and the client made the assumption that I would just input the address into the car's nav system (he knew not anything about my car), so he didn't give me directions, he just gave me the street and number of the destination to plug into my nav.
A Garmin certainly works fine, folks often say they are superior to the factory systems (other than not being integrated with the rest of the car's ""avionics"".) It is just a preference (of mine) to have everything built in.
Hence my frequent close: Drive it like YOU live. I submit, however, that all of this tech will soon, soon, soon be standard and that there will be a bunch of new tech none of us have even imagined, yet.
Besides, I wouldn't pull over and ask for directions or attempt to use a map, if threatened with pain and death."
1039,"August 26, 2014 7:11PM",justg0,"I use Navi too - but not the factory installed as they get outdated and are not as good as Google Maps. Google Maps on my Android device automatically picks the best route for me out of the possible 3 options I have to work based on the traffic conditions. And it keeps recomputing in realtime as I am driving. It tells me if alternate routes will be X minutes faster or slower. Maps are always up-to-date. It has information of road closures, accidents, everything I need.
And since it is on my phone or my computer (same Google maps), I can lookup the route beforehand to plan ahead and I see the same route in my car.
With Ok Google Now, I rarely need to type in the address or destination. The voice recognition is pretty good and I can lookup and navigate to addresses and destinations.
The phone connects via Bluetooth so all the voice turn-by-turn directions are played via the car speaker system. If I have music playing (again via bluetooth audio), it will pause the music to speak out the directions.
And all of this is Free.
I don't think I can every go back to factory installed navi."

I am at the other end of the entrepreneur scale from you. In a previous life I was self-employed (owner-operator driving a KW), but for the 30+ years since I've been working for ""the man"" in the form of an international conglomerate. I balance my 401K once or twice a year and my finances look pretty good, compared to the high-flyers over the years.
I enjoy driving more than I do cars (in the art form, keep them polished but never dirve them sense), and my work allows me to do so, at their expense.
I could have retired three years ago and continued to draw as much money as I do now, but I've chosen to continue to work. This puts more into the 401(K), as opposed to taking it out, and keeps me entertained. There's nothing quite like working in an environment in which I could quit at any time, and the supervision knows it."

In Google Maps on-line you can save the route you choose and have it sent to your BMW (car has to have Navi and BMW assist), it's a pretty slick system they have, you can set it up to go from Point A to B to C to D if you like.

They were recently bought by google (a yr ago)- it uses real time driver info from users and the reporting is via users. Gives info on traffic, weather, potholes and best of all Cop locations.

Plus, I'm lucky enough to be on enough car lists that the manufacturers seem to be sending me $25-$50-$100 gift cards just to stop in their dealerships. I oblige them.
The inherent risk (and the dealers who know me, know this) is that I fall in love with something. Before you know it, out comes the check book. So, I try to temper what I drive, and when. If property taxes are due, that's a good time to test drive. I'm less likely to pull out the checkbook (which would be severely depleted at that time.

1047,"August 27, 2014 9:11AM",robr2,"Mass DOT has implemented a system similar to Waze on major highways. Starting in 2012, the state set up Bluetooth readers and message boards. It's called Go Time. They anonymously read Bluetooth devices in your car and measure when you get to other readers to estimate how much time it is between set points. That information is sent to the message boards and to an app called RTTM.
And it does all that without any interaction from the user or Waze's silly icons.
One can use the message boards to plan your drive or check the RTTM app on your phone. I'd like to see something like this expanded to nav systems."

Like everything in mass this will be slow - as this is a 2012 announcement, and they have not marketed an app or website. tsure they have signs everywhere and they do have real time traffic to certain exits on highways but this does not help in planning a trip. So it's great when you are already sitting in traffic and it tells you it's 30 mins to go another 10 miles,

WaZe uses users speed and not just interactions - but the interactions are what make it better- ""Police Ahead"" helps and will never be integrated with MassDot"

http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/apple-carplay.html
Still trying to figure out how this will work.
Via Bluetooth, I can already use my iPhone's phone functions. I can also get the spoken Buetooth directions through the TL's sound system via maps. I can ask Siri questions and get answers via Siri connected to bluetooth.
So, if they're planning even more integration (say, just having a screen where an iPhone displays it's maps and bluetooth where the directions can be heard), I'm thinking onboard Nav systems may be a thing of the past."

You can see that the touchscreen in car shows the phone icons. And the screen in the car also display the Apple Maps & turn-by-turn directions.
Looks like it is up to car manufacturers to integrate car play in the car. For 2014 the list includes Ferrari, Honda, Hundai, MB and Volvo. Others are listed in future."
1054,"August 27, 2014 2:29PM",markcincinnati,"I think virtually the entire in-car ""avionics"" or ""carvionics"" should be able to be updated by BlueTooth streaming from (why not) a smart phone. New features and functions could be loaded into the dash's brain just like an app can be downloaded into your smartphone.
Certain things, I'm sure, would require hardware upgrades, but heck, make everything a module (as if it isn't already in a lot of cases) that could be plucked out like a radio head unit and replaced with new technology. And, why not make things at least one, if not more generations backwardly compatible (with some loss of functionality).
Right now I want to update (replace actually) that piece of crap Audi Connect ""hardware"" that apparently, forces me to have but ONE choice, other than to go without -- T-Mobile. I go less than 5 miles and the connection drops to 2G, which totally kills Google Maps and the eye in the sky-view on the screen. Even 3G isn't all that great.
Yet, right there, on the showroom floor is an A3 with 4G LTE -- which is pretty much like being there (and the carrier is AT&T which works about 98% of the time compared with T-Mobile's 70% of the time.) There must be a ""module"" under the dash that is nothing more than a ""smart phone"" without the phone case.
Or, why not allow the ""phone"" to be ""unlocked"" and allow, via software, me to use another, more reliable carrier.
Heck, for all I know T-Mobile is great (just not in Ohio), elsewhere.
Update-able tech, that's what's next -- or at least it should be. Of course, I think EVERYTHING should be standard on the car as it comes from the factory. Then, if you want the option, you pay for it -- you don't get rid of the car. This could even be done for many engine performance enhancements -- base cars comes with 200HP and 200 ft/lbs of torque. Pay the man (the dealer) to turn on the next level up the performance ladder and the engine now cranks out 250HP and 275 ft/lbs., etc etc.
I'm not suggesting a basic BMW 3-series come to market equipped with a software hobbled M3 powerplant -- awaiting someone to pay for the upgrade to have the secret code entered. More like what IBM does with some of their hardware that can be upgraded for the end of month processing -- for a fee and then returned to normal for the routine daily processing of data."
1055,"August 27, 2014 7:06PM",andys120,"Our Epic ELLPC Road Trip
My wife and I recently completed an extensive motor tour of the Intermountain West in our 2001 BMW 330 Ci Cabriolet. Sometimes in this topic we lose sight of the fact that these cars aren't just about high tech features and luxury appointments, they're about enjoying driving . I thought I'd give you some impressions about what it's like to take one of these ELLP cars on an extensive road trip.
I'm not going to give you a travelogue of what we saw and did but talk about the journey, which, if you love to drive, is as important as the destinations. I'm well aware that the convertible version of the Three Series isn't the sort of vehicle most would choose for such a trip, in fact the default choice for such long-distance touring is a motor home/RV or Fifth-wheel trailer. I understand the appeal of such vehicles but pros get paid good money for driving large heavy vehicles because driving them is a chore, at least IMO.
If you love driving and haven't driven in the Far West you should put it on your bucket list. You can really drive out there, speed limits are high and traffic enforcement is light. The roads (with some notable exceptions*) are in beautiful shape and even the Interstates have dramatic curves, steep grades (up to 7%!) and the most spectacular scenery you'll see anywhere.
Our 14 year old Bimmer performed beautifully without any problems other than a healthy appetite for 91 Octane (we averaged 28 MPG) and took to the highway as an autobahn-bred car should. We always had more than enough power and brakes to handle anything and the sublime steering made every mile a pleasure.
The major drawback of course was the small size, it wouldn't be suitable for more than two on such a long trip. We took advantage of the feature that allows one to flip away the recess where the top goes when it's down which greatly increased luggage space but robbed us of the ability to cruise topless until had we offloaded the bags. I've been a convertible guy for a long time but I wouldn't care to go more than two or three hours w the top lowered anyway. Thanks to the well-designed top, the Three-er Cabrio makes a very nice Grand Touring coupe w the top in place
.
After 20 days, 4500 miles and 8 states (AZ/UT/ID/OR/MT/WY/NV) we arrived home tired but satisfied after a great drive in a wonderful car.
*Western roads are generally in fine shape with a couple of notable exceptions (mostly in Montana and I-40 in Western AZ is surprisingly bad give the state's rep for good roads) but they are littered with ""Road Alligators"", shreds of truck tires, one of which tore up the lower front grille and left side fog light. This is surprising in light of the proliferation of truck inspection stations. Don't they ever notice that the tires on these big rigs are crap?"

I know a guy with a 2011 S4 and he was using his back up camera while backing up and it caused him to wreck his side mirror housing on the right side. The problem is the screen doesn't show your sides, only the rear.
I forced my insurance to replace the aluminum side mirror housing due to a chip from my accident in March. I now know why they ignored the small chip originally, as the part is $500 and nearly $600 installed.
My money was better spent getting the 3.0T, the S-Tronic DSG, the Sport Diff, and the Nappa Leather than on Navigation or backup cameras.
Some people don't want to spend $50K, let alone MORE THAN $50K to get a great vehicle.

1064,"August 28, 2014 7:43PM",andres3,"I finally stopped being cheap and hired the collision claims consultants that were recommended to me for a professional unbiased independent diminished value appraisal that finally happened mid-August. It refutes the DV appraisal Mercury (at fault insured's company) paid for where they claimed my car sustained no structural damage (what about pulling an upper right rail isn't structural)? claimed it could be a certified used Audi still (no dealer I talked to seems eager to Certify a $22K+ repair billed S4. Car Max saw bolts spun on the hood and fender and that was enough for them to only offer wholesale price at $37K. They claimed they'd wholesale it, but part of me thinks they'd turn around and list it for $10K more at $47K.
Based on their ""outside the ballpark of reality"" DV report, Mercury only offered $1K for DV. They upped it to 1.5K in a fake attempt to settle the claim.
I've now sent my demand based on a ""REAL"" report that seems to be in the ball park of reality at $8850 DV amount. Plus the $445 fee and the $2,400 for rental car and insurance deductible expenses. I know they only have a $10K pot to pay out, so I'll settle for $10K total. They just want to delay this claim forever, and their tactics to frustrate me worked. I should of hired this DV Appraisal company from the beginning; I was wasting time without their help.
I now have 20 boiler plate letters to refute the predictable excuses and false claims/reasons they can't pay my demand. It's kind of hilarious the letters I received answer and refute some of the BS reasons I've already been given.
Each letter gives them 15 days to respond in writing which is more than reasonable. I predict they will offer to split the difference between their $1K DV report and my 8.8K DV report. One of the 20 letters is ready to go on that excuse. Their report is just so inaccurate, and the CarMax appraisal will help show that if need be.
Could take 4 to 5 more letters going back and forth before I get paid, or worst case scenario, I have to take them to small claims court for $10K. The thing is these letters help build a ""bad faith lawsuit/claim"" if they refuse to pay up, so maybe a lawyer would take my case at that point. No lawyers seemed interested in talking to me over a potential $15K property damage claim.

1071,"September 8, 2014 1:08PM",markcincinnati,"When I pulled up to the sidewalk and parked in the No Parking zone, the boys’ bicycles were on their kick stands under the porte cochère at the back of the public library where the night drop off for books and, in my case, DVD’s is located. The library wouldn’t be open for more than an hour, so I assumed the boys were just there to get out of the hot morning sun. I put the DVD’s into the slot, nodded at the boys and turned around heading back to my idling car. Just about when I got to the driver’s door, one of the boys said “How much did that [car] cost?” I replied, “How much do you think?” The young man and his friend yelled back in unison, “A lot!” I told them it cost about $57,000, and I heard oo’s and ah’s in response. I drove off, giving them a quick honk and a wave.
What’s the point?
The point is, I’ve been thinking, saying and writing about what I assumed is the pending death of the automobile as most of us here know and love it. I’ve been of that opinion because it seems to me that virtually anyone under the age of 35 (or maybe under-30) seems as if they could care less about cars beyond them being appliances or means to get from point-to-point. These “young people” wouldn’t or couldn’t talk about cars if you threatened them with pain and death, and wouldn’t even bother to feign interest to win the new not-yet-released iPhone 6, so little interest do these folks seem to have in cars. These two young men gave me hope!
Now, I’ll bet when you and I were in our formative (‘tween through teen-age) years, we had but several topics we cared to opine about: Cars, Girls [or boys] and Sex. I my case, I was a budding audiophile, too, which kind of rounded out the whole emerging nerd stereotype. Had there been personal computers (of any stripe) or video games available (it was the early to mid-60’s and such tech had not yet been introduced to the mainstream market), I most certainly would’ve been into them; but instead I was into “stereo” in addition to cars, girls and sex (talking about sex, not actually having it, of course).
So when I was with my buds, the topic was often the “cars we were gonna be driving” as soon as we turned 16. We were dreamers, of course – we, then, were the kids sitting at the library entrance (where else?) watching the guy drive up in his new 1965 Bonneville pillar-less four-door painted in dark blue metallic with a ton of chrome accents and shiny chrome hub-caps and big ol’ tires (white walls, of course).
“Hey mister, how much did that thing cost?” The reply, at the time, was “About $4,000,” and of course we then obliged by making the same oo and ah sounds like the ones I heard the other morning.
My overarching point to this erudite group of auto enthusiasts here at Edmunds is that I believe we are pretty much smitten with cars and everything to do with them – but that we’re also mostly predisposed to acquire one of these Premium (or near-premium) Class cars based on history, loyalty or perhaps even looks. I would submit if you’ve had more than one representative of the same brand (back to back), that your next car is perhaps pre-ordained to come from that manufacturer. Loyalty to a brand is – along with several other characteristics – another sign that you are passionate about cars. You’ve come to identify yourself with BMW’s (a quite common occurrence here in Cincinnati) – you are a “BMW guy”. My friend, now President of his second software company had an Acura when I met him. In our times in the car often driving from Cincinnati to Chicago or to Bowling Green (KY), he would go on and on about what I’m convinced must be the best car in the world – at least he certainly thought so: the BMW M5. This guy was about 10-years my junior.
Thankfully he didn’t have to keep the Acura long – so less than a year after I met him he leased his first (of many) BMW’s – a 3-series. Followed by a 5, then a 7 then one of the “Z” car convertibles (he called that one Penis).
I submit that most of us here are (or want to be) “XXX” guys (intended to be gender neutral, don’t you know). You’re a Mercedes maven, you’re a BMW bigot and I’m an Audi aficionado. No matter what “empirical” data is brought to bear, you’re sure your new IS 350 F-Sport is superior to that guy’s BMW 328 – after all, Car & Driver says so; and, you just know you can run circles around the Bimmer’s 4-cylinder, turbo and all.
So it is with the foreknowledge that no matter how much evidence I can produce to the contrary, you will remain steadfast that your own sagacity has been validated and put on display for all to see by your choice of the latest and greatest Volvo S60 (or whatever).
So where does that leave us?
With hope, I hope.
The upcoming generation still needs to ratchet up their passion for all things automotive – or we could be doomed to forever being but passengers in our autonomous vehicles. But, I think there is some evidence, not much, but a little, that there are kids who are just as interested in cars as they are video games, social media (and, hopefully, sex).
There may be some hope, too, that those of “us” who may not as of yet yet been inculcated by a Brand of automobile, may find our personal automotive archetype and to coin a phrase, “Live long and prosper.”
I’ll close by saying this: While I still remain convinced that the Audi S4 is the best representative of the Entry-level Luxury Performance Sedan (and for the money it damn well ought to be), I must say, after having visited the Acura dealer to “See what’s new,” that the new TLX SH-AWD in Advance trim (the one with the 6-cylinder), ought to be this category’s leader if “price” (MSRP) is factored in. If you haven’t checked out this exact configuration (I can’t offer the same praise for the lesser TLX’s), I urge you to do so before you spend one dime on a new ELLPS car – this thing (the 2015, to be clear) is IMPRESSIVE!

This is gettin' serious now: ""Nissan Plans to Make Autonomous Driving Common by 2016""
-- Motor Trend, October 2014; Pg - 26
You know what Pogo said: ""We have met the enemy and he is us.""
Well ""us"" -- and we know who we are -- killed (or at least put it on its death-bed) the stick shift. Now, of course that's only partially true -- at least if you even a tiny bit agree that the DSG (aka PDK) dual clutch 'automatic manual' transmission is (and I hate to say this) equal to or better than the best manual transmissions ever made. But so few of ""us"" actually have these marvelous inventions -- and, I'll wager, the number of folks with the excellent 8-speed automatics available is also still somewhat small.
I can only sort of forgive YOU and hold my head up high with righteous indignation: Because god knows my wife and I did our parts to preserve the manual transmissions going so far as to custom order nearly 2-and-a-half-dozen German cars with stick shifts since 1977 (we finally quit this practice out of the sheer futility of the act when we realized that [most of] the rest of YOU -- overwhelmingly -- had given up on stick shifts years earlier). And, my wife was appalled to read some of lame excuses, most of them blaming ""the wife"" for her inability to pilot a car with a stick shift.
Of course, there is always that nagging feeling that the mobile phone also played a big part in killing the stick shift; even today it seems I don't have enough digits to count the number of cars I see being driven down the road with the driver holding a cell phone to his or her ear. So what? I forgot to mention the ""phones in the ear"" (thus requiring one free hand) I am counting are for the drivers' of cars that I know have Bluetooth! These drivers should be forced to ride the bus for one-full-year or pay a 5-figure fine (or both). This morning, in fact, I saw a woman (phone in ear) in a very young Maserati (with temp tags it was so new) pulling into Starbucks. I could only wonder if she was going to attempt to be on the phone and drink coffee all the while driving in rush hour traffic here in River City.
The point? Qwit yur complainin', for the Market has spoken.
But this latest outrage -- autonomous driving (by 2016 no less) -- is, some will say, both inevitable and welcome. Perhaps. It is also inevitable that we will -- eventually -- run out of fossil fuel. But we're talking decades and decades if you believe many of the scholarly studies from think tanks like the Rand Corporation to name one.
Mean time, WHO (among us) is asking for self-driving cars? I'd rather pay more taxes (and I can't believe I said that) if some of them could be earmarked for public transportation infrastructure improvements and additions. A one-person (or 4 person) public transportation vehicle (manifested in the form of a self-driving passenger vehicle), is not something I want to sign up for.
On the other hand, I do want driver aids: laser headlights, night-vision, ""city safety"", all around-view cameras, rear cross traffic alerts -- even automatic cruise control for those 100+ mile stints behind the wheel that are part of my weekly routine trips between Cincinnati and Columbus or Cincinnati and Louisville or Indianapolis.
I want a connected car (better even than that which is in my 2014 S4: ""Audi Connect""), but I still want to press the pedals (most of the time, anyway) and turn the steering wheel myself.
I am [now, happily] resigned to allowing my dual-clutch 7-speed automatic manual transmission to do the rowing for me, but I am far, far, far from wanting my car to drive itself. Indeed, I'm mostly sure I don't even want the thing to park itself, thank you very much.
The only good news in the Nissan announcements (if you can call it ""good"") is that Nissan claims they will NOT ELIMINATE the need for human interaction (like some competitors -- gulp).
""There is no need to sally forth, for it remains true that those things which make us human are, curiously enough, always close at hand. Resolve then, that on this very ground, with small flags waving and tinny blast on tiny trumpets, we shall meet the enemy, and not only may he be ours, he may be us.""
Drive it like you live -- but do drive it yourself."

1089,"September 9, 2014 12:12PM",andres3,"A seven speed manual would be interesting to compete on fuel economy with the 7 speed DSG/S-tronic. Gas is too expensive to entertain the thought of settling for the available 6-speed manual S4 which is still available (probably only by special order). Audi probably thinks the only people that'll order a manual will do so despite the mileage penalty, and there's so few they won't bother developing a 7 speed with 3 pedals."
1090,"September 9, 2014 12:28PM",andres3,"Got my S4 back today from the body shop, 4 trips total, 68 days total in the shop, and the car is looking and driving great. I think I finally got them to do it ""right."" Still not perfect mind you, but good work that should of been done the first time without repeated return trips to correct deficient work.
I just don't think they have enough ""skill"" in their work force Still, for my money I think the ""body shop"" in Ingoldstadt is superior and better. Audi proved to me they do tremendous quality control with this S4 at the factory. They obviously build them to appease guys like me that notice when gaps and panels are off by a MM or two.
This last visit was to correct inconsistent gaps with the front hood, lack of buffing/polishing on the front fender and front quarter/fender panels, and 2 bad paint edges at 2 locations on the hood (which was replaced).
I drove a new NON SH-AWD 6 cyl. TLX and wasn't impressed at all. The transmission is lazy, why'd they give the 4 cyl the better tranny? Why no exhaust? Why less HP than the outgoing TL SH-AWD? This is your Camry/Prius-like TLX.
Perhaps the SH-AWD is another animal? Admittedly, putting the transmission in sport or sport+ mode made it less lazy, but still lacking. I heard the dual clutch still has a torque converter. NO NO NO Acura... no no no.
Oh, and the moon roof cover is cardboard covered in vinyl.....compare it to the S4's and you'll believe me that the TLX is an overpriced Accord."
1091,"September 9, 2014 2:07PM",markcincinnati,"=====
The number of years before the literal elimination of manual transmissions even from some of the performance stalwarts is damn few. The number of years before the virtual elimination of manual transmissions is even fewer, and some would say that time has already arrived.
The truth (my truth, at this point) of the matter is that the 7-speed (and most of the German/European 8-speed versions) is (are) so good, I only miss shifting for sentimental reasons.
I don't think I ever was as capable (and certainly not as quick/fast) a shifter as the S-Tronic in my S4. And, the tuning of my wife's 8-speed in her SQ5 is very very close to that same ideal.

Matter of fact, like a lot of upscale cars, there's no visible exhaust pipes at all on the TLX.

I know it's early, but the numbers suggest Acura has a hit on their hands with. They want to sell 44K of them over 12 mos. They are on track to sell 50K to 60K (probably closer to 50K once the initial flurry slows down).

Something for everyone....4 cyl with DCT, and all wheel steer or 6 cyl. with SH AWD if you want it. As good in the tech dept as anything else on the road, and probably better than most. Performance that's competitive. Value equation that is probably best in class.

Plus, they're about darn near impossible to break, they last a long time, and they don't cost much to maintain or operate.

http://www.acura.com/PressReleases.aspx

""High strength steel uses include:

UISBOR – USIBOR is a boron-alloyed steel with an aluminum-silicon coating that protects against oxidation during the heating, forming and hardening process. This high-strength hot-stamp steel is used for the TLX's door opening rings, for 5% of the unit body. (See Safety section for more information.)
980 grade HSS – Used in certain key structural points such as the front edges of the door sills, and in the A-pillars and B-pillars, for 2% of the unit body.
780 grade HSS – Used for most structural load paths for ACE™, including the side sills and forward spars of unit body, for 2% of the unit body.

Magnesium Steering Hanger Beam
Located behind the instrument panel, a 3-piece magnesium steering-hanger beam replaces the 26-piece aluminum and steel unit in the previous TL model. Its purpose is as a structural attachment point for the steering column, pedals and instrument panel, as well as a structural element that helps the passenger cabin retain its shape in certain collisions. This single robust magnesium component makes up 2-percent of the TLX's body weight...."""
1115,"September 14, 2014 3:47PM",stickguy,"OK, stopped at the dealer yesterday, and had a chance to see the TLX in person (did not drive, will do that when I take my TL in for an oil change soon).

they had a couple of black ones on the apron (did not scope out due to pouring rain). But, there was a graphite lustre (same color as my RDX) in the showroom. a V6 FWD. Overall, very nice. Loved the looks. Even the front end was sharp, particularly the headlights. Beak did not offend. the rest of the car had enough curves and design points to be interesting, without feeling overwrought.

Interior, very nice. pretty much shares the dash with the MDX it seems (the RDX and ILX are close to each other too). Well done. Nice, clean dash and very ""Acuraish"" super duper comfy seats. back seat to me was fine. I am 6' with a long torso, and had no problem with leg or head room. Might not be quite as big as the Legacy we drove, but plenty of space for 4 adults. Trunk was acceptable.

not a huge car, but certainly seemed to fit the entry level luxury profile. Performance? Well, the V6 is going to be fast, just based on how fast my RDX is, and the TLX s/b lighter and has more gears.

oh, the ""shifter"" gizmo on the V6 was a bit odd. Simple to use, but just strange. Did not get a chance to see a 4 cyl which has a normal gear shift.

I plan to drive a 4 cyl base car if they have one available in the next week or 2 when I go back down."
1116,"September 14, 2014 3:53PM",stickguy,"oh, and as I typed this, saw about 3-4 different ads for the TLX on the Jets game. So Acura is making a push for selling this car. I think it will do well, assuming it drives as well as the car shows (particularly the interior and feature content).

my one big peeve? They pulled a Hyundai and deleted the spare tire. No run flats (a good thing) but just a can of fix a flat, and a cheap pump. I just refuse to own a car that has no back up plan for a bad tire. Did not explore/question if you could just take out the foam tray under the trunk floor and put a donut in there. Heck, the Legacy not only had a tire, it was on a matching alloy wheel! and per the salesman, was rated for 200 miles."

1118,"September 14, 2014 8:10PM",tlong,"I rented a BMW 328 last week while staying in Las Vegas.

In short, I was particularly underwhelmed by this car. This is coming from somebody who currently drives an '05 TL and previously had a 6 cylinder Audi A4.

The BMW was black and is gorgeous outside. I was a bit surprised at how low the roof is on this car - definitely not a lot of headroom.

Since it's a rental, I'll grant that this was probably a downmarket trim level vehicle. The seats were black and I'm not sure if they were leather or leatherette - I suspect the vinyl as they didn't have a leather smell. The seat bottoms were very flat with almost no bolstering. In general, although the car did have nav, I didn't feel the interior was very upmarket. Seemed pretty middling to me - not as cheap as entry-level cars, but certainly not luxe, either. The trunk is large laterally but is shallow.

The automated nanny behavior had me screaming thoughts of repair costs had I owned this car. The electronic shifter seemed more gimmicky than useful. The auto-engine shutoff was exactly as has been described here - unrefined and jerky on restart. Yes, you can disable it but you need to do that every time you get back in the car.

I thought the steering was a bit numb and vague on-center. The ride was decent but not that quiet. The engine was refined for a 4 but not all that smooth to me. I didn't push the car as I was in traffic, but this car firmly convinced me that I didn't want to pay north of $40K for a 3-series."
1119,"September 16, 2014 4:09AM",circlew,"TLong, did you try the TLX yet? I haven't had interest in the TL since your series was destroyed by the last gen TL but I'd like to get your take to compare to the '05 you have.

I appreciated the reviews from others here as well and did some research on the TLX. Sounds good but haven't seen one live.

I've been pricing the 335is used. I'd never go for the 328 or lower. The 2 series is too small for me and the premium for new 335's are too dear for my aching college-ravished bank account!"
1120,"September 16, 2014 5:57AM",graphicguy,"One of the things that always confounded me was how you go up the lux car ladder, that things like metallic paint was a costly option. My former S4, which didn't have metallic paint, made it available for a fairly significant extra charge. I think my 335i had metallic black paint that ran somewhere near $600 extra. My TL's? No extra charge. And, Acura puts a very nice paint job on their cars to boot....easily as good as anything else on the market, most times better.

While Acura isn't immune to trying to get people to pay more for leather, all but the base TLX's have leather....and it is a very nice leather....soft, high quality. MB tries to push their vinyl to be as good as leather. From what I can tell, they seem to do a good marketing job on that front.

Was in Costco last night. They always seem to have BMWs in the front as an enticement to use their car buying service. They had a 435i xDrive with the M Sport package....dark metallic grey with red leather interior. It was equipped exactly the way I'd want it. Very nice. But, as I suspected, it was knocking on the door of $60K. For $60K I could negotiate a new Corvette plus a Spark for daily driving duties."

Other than the body shop ""coolant hose"" debacle, it has been flawless and perfect mechanically. No breakdowns, no problems, no issues.

I love the car. It is amazingly fun to drive and flog around turns at extremely high rates of speed. I feel like I have double the power and control with Quattro and the 3.0 vs. my old FWD 2.0T.

I did find one issue, I'm getting into the music file market (still a CD guy), and I like high resolution ""HD"" music files... like FLAC, but Audi doesn't support anything but MP3 and AAC (the two worst for sound quality). The manual says up to 320 bit rates but in my testing only 256 will work, at least in AAC.

Using ITunes to turn a CD into AIFF, AAC, ALAC, WAV I found only 256 AAC to work. (avoided MP3 all together but that works too; though I didn't test 320 bit rate MP3 yet).

Shame on Audi for not being up to date with FLAC support in a 2014 car. I even have the Bang & Olufsen upgraded sound system, so you'd think they'd support modern quality."
1139,"September 30, 2014 1:40PM",flightnurse,"The ""upgraded sound system"" is only speakers and amp, not head unit. I also think the reason for not supporting FLAC has to be the HD space. Since the files would be too large.

In regards to sound quality, and this subject has been beaten to death on the forums like Car Audio also people like Harry Kimura (he lives in San Diego and is the grand father of the modern day aftermarket sound competition) if you truly want sound quality in your S4 then contact usdaudio.com/ they are the only people who I would allow to touch my car. Sound Quality comes at a price, and that weigh and space. So if you could get your FLAC files to work, they wouldn't sound all that much different especially driving down the road. If you think your S4 is quite now, you should hear what 200lbs of sound deadening will do to your car. But then it comes at a price, added weight.. Current car audio has come a long way from the days when I work in then car audio industry...

People who compete in the car audio competition spend HOURS making their cars as quite as possible. When they go through the SQ (Sound Quality) check their engines must be running so of course they do not want anything entering the cabin. This is why I said to use a CD instead of the FLAC files. Who remembers DAT (Digital Audio Tape) players poor Panasonic (for the car) thought they were going to be future and make CD's obsolete, the sampling rate was far superior then that of CD's but did not hold the same amount of music as the CD.

If so, please post your driving impressions -- the TLX seems to be getting less than stellar reviews from the likes of Automobile, C&D, MotorTrend & R&T. Funny thing, to me at least, Acura put the transmission that the paid car reviewers seem positive about in the 4-cylinder rather than in the high contented, big motor, SH-AWD version.

The TLX 8-speed dual clutch (but with torque converter -- a rarity) transmission in the 4 is everyone's darlin'. Then the review turns ugly by suggesting that the 9-speed V6 just feels [essentially] fat, sluggish (due to its apparent porky-ness) and a lot less fun.

On the other hand, the new C-Class is lauded as a baby S class.

Who's driven these here? Tell me more, tell me more -- in many ways, your opinions are the ones that matter most."
1146,"October 3, 2014 1:37PM",markcincinnati,"The ""She's Too Fat Polka""!

Not too long back, I took out a new S6 and was smitten by the intoxicating power of the thing, as well as its ability to blend sportiness and luxury into one sweet, sophisticated and sporty package.

Another month, about, has passed with my S4 -- now at 17,300 miles.

And, while I am certain another wild drive in an S6 would have me again tumescent with desire for this $80K super-sedan, it's just too damn fat, too big in the overall scheme of things. What would be really to my tastes, with the benefit of hindsight now, would be a slightly larger S4 -- add about an inch or so to the wheelbase, make it another 3 or 4 db quieter and put the SQ5 engine in it (for the added torque, natch). Open it up just a smidge in size and power -- 333HP and 325 ft/lbs just are about at a point in the marketplace to require a bit of a bump northward.

Here we sit with no new 4's coming until 2016 MY and, if history repeats, no new S4 for at least another year (or two) beyond that.

Now, if someone wanted to provide me with a new S6 for a couple of years at no charge, well, you can be certain I would not re-gift it.

My comments pertaining to my opinion that the S4 will certainly require a power boost to remain competitive are a good example of ""situational velocitization"". That is what used to feel really quick and fast, well, feels simply ""normal"" these days.

The only cure for this velocitization is to get an A4 2.0T loaner for a day or two, so I can essentially push my quickness and speed reset button, for there is surely no lack of quickness or speed in my S4 -- I've just gotten used to it so much I take it for granted.

Drive it like you live."
1147,"October 3, 2014 6:35PM",sweendogy,"Mark I just had a 15 loaner a4 - and missed every bit go the s4 power for those 2 days. With The new s3 at almost 3oohp I would guess the power bump for the next s4 should be close to 400, but I have not seen any publications on this figure. Maybe that is to high of a figure given the s6 is at 425- that would get us to the Sq5 's 350ish listing. I would love to see a dyno of a stock s4 and a stock sq5 - something tells me they are closer the you think."
1148,"October 6, 2014 9:24AM",markcincinnati,"Here's my [generally in violent agreement] thought about that power figure, sween: Ever escalating abilities to get power, coupled with a market that seems to have an endless appetite for more power may well take the next S4 (not the RS4, the S4) to 400 HP. Yet, there may be good reasons NOT to go there. For instance, isn't it true that part of the cost of our auto-insurance is based on HP (not torque, HP)?

If my assumption on that matter is correct, perhaps AoA will lobby for whatever the next lower HP (below 400) is but press for more readily available torque. Economy and emissions, too, would have to be a consideration, no?

The current 3.0T in the S4 puts out a conservative 333HP and 325 pound feet. The beefed up version in the SQ5 adds 21HP (taking it to 354) and 21 pound feet (getting us to 346). The crank is a heavier duty part than in the S4 iteration and apparently the SQ5 engine is ""strong enough"" to be cranked to another like increase without breaking much, if any, of a sweat.

A new model S4 with 375HP and 367 pound feet might just be the Goldilocks answer (at least in the US). This would leave plenty of ""headroom"" for either a blown V8 or an even more tightly tuned V6 (T) to be fitted into an RS4 model. Indeed, based on what is easily do-able these days with plain ol' ""normal"" forced induction (super or turbo), twin-charging (super AND turbo) or other, ""compound induction"" derivatives, I wouldn't be shocked to ""hear-tell"" of an S4 with a 4 cylinder engine of some-kind or another, putting out an easy-peasy 350HP with gobs of low end torque, either.

Program note:

For reasons that would require at least two more paragraphs, I will tell you that I was cruising along at about 67 MPH on I-71 N (north of the I-275 interchange this Saturday PM last). I had the ""need"" to ""punch it"" -- and for the count of 1, 2, 3 floored the S4, cleared the incident, glanced at my digital read-out and found it reading 100. Under the circumstances (light traffic, four lanes heading north, etc), I was simply able to coast down to a relatively legal 68 without the need for the dampers. I realize the S6 seemed to do this exact same thing in what I ""recall"" as 1,2,3 -- the difference is that the S6 did so with practically zero drama. The S4 made all kinds of fun sounds as it made the jump to light speed.


Newer S4's will, due to market conditions, surely come with more grunt than current versions, but for the life of me, I find it difficult to imagine ever being able (or rarely so) to use such power.

1,2,3 -- the thing is like a freakin' sling-shot.

Dizzy with the rush of speed, I leave you saying ""Drive it like you live""!"

1150,"October 7, 2014 9:54AM",flightnurse,"Mark interesting thought, and you are probably right, look at the 335i 300hp and torque, with the MPPK and MPE you are looking at 335-340hp easily and BMW is very conservative with their HP rating. The current M3/4 makes 425hp (but a recent dyno test shows the M4 making 435hp at the rear wheel) so if Audi where to bring a RS4 you would right to saying it would be 400+hp, more like 450hp and not from a V8, but from a V6.

I have not driven a new M3/4 yet but from articles they are some scary machines, the amount of power they make can be very over whelming, do cars of that size need more HP? Right now, the biggest issue BMW has with the M3/4 is getting the rear wheels to hook up.

And Mark if I had a M4 and drove it like I lived, I wouldn't have a license..."
1151,"October 8, 2014 9:57AM",markcincinnati,"Flight -- even with the 333HP my S4 claims to have (which Motor Trend says is an understatement), I can only assume my time (to a speeding ticket) can now be measured -- at most -- in weeks.

Of course, with all the crazy people on I-71 North heading from Cinti to Columbus thinking 80MPH is a good place to START, well, there may be safety in numbers.

I can't seem to make this thing slow down -- I mean it seems that it keeps pushing me to go faster and the heck of it is, I'm too willing to abide.

I saw the Motor Week test report of the M3 -- talk about trying to control the wrath of gawd . . . . Even with the wider rear rubber the thing was wheel spin happy to the max.

I somehow doubt there will be an RS4 (or RS6) brought here -- the RS7 was, in my opinion, just a demonstration to show that Audi could bring a very high performance car to the US for what some see as a relative bargain. A higher output S4, well, that I am willing to bet will be brought here -- just like I'll bet there will be higher output ""335's"" brought here, too."

Base price: Currently unknown, but expected to be around $70,000.

Fuel economy: Unknown, but based on the Model S specs, expect a figure around 95 mpge from the 60kWh battery option.

Pros and cons: The Tesla Model X, expected out this fall, is the crossover to wait for if you want something truly different. In true Tesla style, it’s completely electric; it features falcon-wing doors that lift up and an all-wheel drive option that will make it the first production electric car to run on all fours; and it also has Tesla’s trademark 17-inch touchscreen center console. It has the usual EV drawbacks, though: limited range coupled with potentially long recharging times.

Options worth splurging on: It might come to the detriment of range, but the all-wheel drive model might be too good to pass up.

These vehicles are in the baby phases. Give this industry another 5 to 10 years with more research and cost cutting ways where most buyers can afford similar models like mentioned.


Tesla moved an estimated 4,600 Model S vehicles in the U.S. in the first three months of 2014 -- 1,600 in March and 3,100 in January/February. 11,000 vehicles have been sold to date this year.

The Nissan leaf ev leads all sales in the US with almost 22k units sold ytd. followed by the VOLT at 14k.

Most of the P85D's power is the rear. There, it will have a 470-horsepower motor. But unlike the current performance model, it adds a 221-horsepower motor in front."
1160,"October 12, 2014 9:39AM",Mr_Shiftright,"I priced out a fully optioned maximum, all you can buy Tesla during a test drive and it came out to just over $130,000. Maybe ""entry-level"" for the 1% ?"
1161,"October 12, 2014 5:44PM",sweendogy,@Mr_Shiftright‌ - right its not for the 1%rs. At that price level it's a comp to the s class- the standard.
1162,"October 12, 2014 7:02PM",Mr_Shiftright,"Hmmm...I don't think the Tesla is worth $130K at least not the current model. It's maybe worth the $75K level. Even the new ""entry-level"" C class Mercedes fully equipped, comes in at $62,000 and it's a match for the Tesla S at the moment, IMO--it even has more tech."
1163,"October 12, 2014 7:05PM",stickguy,I was cruising the used car listings and the local Ford dealer has a used Tesla on their site (pictures showing it in the showroom). No price listed though.
1164,"October 12, 2014 9:27PM",roadburner,"As the Brits would say, I had a bit of a play with a Model S while driving a new 2015 X6 at the truck's international launch in South Carolina. The Tesla was pretty quick, but it seemed to slow and fall back the longer we ""played""- don't know if that was due to the driver, the batteries, or some other issue."
1165,"October 13, 2014 6:27PM",sweendogy,"""IMO--it even has more tech."" I guess that depends what ""tech"" is important. Tesla could be considered one of the best technological advanced companies ever- from production to completion. It's overpriced for sure - and maybe it shouldn't be a comp to the s class- but it's got plenty of tech --maybe not the best radio - any 4 door sedan that can get to 60 in 3.2 seconds and now has an auto pilot feature is pretty cool- oh and it fits 7 people and yes doesn't need gas or oil change."
1166,"October 14, 2014 10:32AM",flightnurse,"Tesla is all about technology, while I was in San Jose in March of this year, my niece took me her favorite hang out, a very upscale shopping and Dinning place called Santana Row in this place is a Tesla Boutique shop we have one here in Phoenix, but they are not allowed to talk price or lease payments, however, at Santana Row they can, in fact they offer test drives, so far San Jose has the most Tesla's I have ever seen on the road, as my niece says, ""they are nice, but they are just another car now."" We were able to take one for a test drive. we drove a Model S 85, it wasn't fully loaded and MSRP was cough $98K , walking from the store to where the cars are at, the employee (not too sure what her tile was) had the car starting to cool off for us. After 20 minutes of showing us how some of the feature work, the key fob was given to me, and I have to say, what an impressive key fob, it is weighted and looks like the car very impressive. The first thing you notice when you settle into the car is how low it is and how long it is. The car had 21"" wheels so it rode a little on the rough side, and of course my tech geeky niece (she works for Sun Microsystems/Oracle) was playing with the center dash touch screen. As Sweeny said, Tesla could be (it really is) considered one of the best technological advanced companies ever. What can be said about elec motors that no one on this forum hasn't read about it, instead torque, scooting around traffic is not a problem, and if you drive it normal the car just purrs along. The car felt solid, but the closing of the doors didn't have the German feel when closing them. Leases are backed by Wells Fargo, and to lease this particular car it would have ran $1300/m with $7500 out of pocket, or purchase the car $1200/m with 10K down but with the 7500 federal tax credit really only 3K out of pocket. Tesla shows that one can build a pure elect car that is not boring and what the true cost of the car is without being subsidized my the motor-company.

If I could convince myself to spend $1200/m for a car I would get one in a heart beat, I love the design and the 265 miles range is not a problem, and I'm seeing more and more charging stations then ever before.

With the Model X and E coming school and the price dropping, who knows I might have one. The model E is to start at about 45K.

Between San Diego and Phoenix a long highway 8 one can see the charging stations and these are the supercharging station which can charge a Model S in under in 20 minutes half full these are free.. ,"
1167,"October 14, 2014 3:32PM",Mr_Shiftright,"It might have ""tech"" but not the latest tech. It's really last year's cellphone already.

From reading that blurb, it looks like the monitoring features are ""forthcoming"".

The sooner the better. Maybe here as we speak?

Actually, the Tesla doesn't have more than a dozen comfort and convenience features that are available in the comparably priced Mercedes S class 2014 model. And the interior isn't up to snuff with the German cars either.

Keep in mind that I test drove a showroom demo, so maybe a Tesla with updated features is now on the road---I don't know.

1173,"October 15, 2014 3:00PM",Mr_Shiftright,"True, but Tesla didn't have to re-invent the wheel and go back to 1896. . It was all out there waiting for them. This is the Auto Industry 2015, not 1955. You have to be on top of your game every minute, because your competition is clever, fierce and relentless.

Not sure who is flagging your posts---not I. Perhaps you could check your PL (Politeness Level) and bring it up a bit for the other members?

Anyway, a Tesla really isn't apropos to this topic--I don't regard it as ""entry-level"" LUX. Optioned out, it's a pretty expensive piece of machinery."
1174,"October 15, 2014 5:14PM",sweendogy,"@Mr_Shiftright‌ - agree they didn't have to go back - they went forward-- the comp is taking notice for sure-and will be trying to copy the model- they have no show rooms - the cars most buy are direct ordered- both reducing costs. They have one of the most efficient assembly line of any product ever- they have no massive unions that have ruined some brands- no pensions of workers no longer on the books. The comp needs to pick up game- proof in stock prices- and reviews. If tesla sold a 50k car (with all the tech you crave) it would compete with the 3 series, no doubt- it's expensive because of the tech needed to roll this car.

I have an idea of who's flagging posts but don't really care I find it funny- I feel my ""PL"" is just fine- I find it hard not to look at facts when talking about cars- everyone has an opinion but its worthless without fact.

1177,"October 20, 2014 12:51PM",markcincinnati,"The new TLX with SH-AWD ought to be the IT car right now in this class (and maybe on this forum). Content-wise, this (and from an actual cost, not MSRP basis, the Q50, too) ought to be setting the world on fire sales-wise.

Seems tho to not be of too much interest here. Once again, my wife and I looked at this car from a bang for the buck perspective (the TLX Advance V6 w/SH-AWD): What even comes close to the combination of features and alleged capabilities for the money?

Now, still NOT having driven one, perhaps the TLX just seems like an expensive Accord -- but on paper, it would seem not.

Further, it seems far enough UNDER $50K to merit ""our"" attention.

Of course the car magazines are just giving the thing the briefest of ""test-reports"" -- and I would say the reviews from the performance perspective are rather mixed, despite the recognition that there seems to be a lot of car for the MSRP.

What am I, what are we not impressed enough with -- the styling, the tinny sounding doors when slammed?

I have a regret, now that I think about it -- I wish, for a lousy $1,000+ bucks that I would have gotten the torque vectoring diff on my S4 (Audi's SH-AWD).

Any TLX SH-AWD owners or wanna be owners here?

Is this thing on?"
1178,"October 20, 2014 1:15PM",stickguy,"I recall reading somewhere recently that it is selling well, at least relative to what it replaced! And have seen some good reports. As always, have to filter the magazine stuff to get to what real people care about. And no, nit everyone here represents the ""average buyer"" for one of these (the same folks that by 320is and don't order the big engine sport pack models).

I have sat in one a few times, and really liked it. And to me it is attractive. Still haven't driven one, but from showroom testing, not confusing it with an accord, any more than an ES350 vs. a Camry XLE.

My guess is Acura never expected a better than 10% take on the AWD model anyway.

But we shall see. Supplies seem to be better now, so will be interesting to see how sales trend through end of the year."

1181,"October 20, 2014 4:32PM",graphicguy,"Stick....S4 is equivalent to a BMW 335i. Then again, it's equivalent to an Acura TL SH AWD that's a tad slower, too.

TLX is a nice ride. I compared the suspension to an E350 when I, test drove it. Tech is better than Mercedes, too. It's finished nicely and has great, premium materials, too. IMHO, it had the best stereo in the biz (ELS). Tranmission shifted quick and smooth enough you won't notice (similar to my E92 335i). Acura prgrammed the trans well. In sport, it will downshift almost telepathically.

It's not as quick as the S4 or the 335i, but it is quick."

So far, so good. I'm a little over 1500 miles in. I just filled up the tank for the 3rd time. I think if I can get the stars to align, I might try for 500 miles on this tank.

The Legacy is a fantastic daily driver. The suspension is comfortable and very well tuned. The 175 horsepower is nothing to brag about, but it does get me up to speed.

I really like the CVT. If I wasn't such a car nut, I'd have no idea this wasn't a conventional automatic. The CVT is quite responsive and very smooth. It adds to the Legacy's overall character and refinement. I haven't had the traffic conditions to ""wring it out"" yet, but the car doesn't ""beg"" to be driven hard like my 328xi did. Good thing too. It seems like the CT State Troopers, the NY State Troopers, Local Stamford PD, & NYPD Highway 1 are stepping up patrols and speed traps big time."

1200,"October 26, 2014 11:44AM",markcincinnati,"S4 M3

Much as I love my S4, the M3 and S4 aren't in the same class -- Audi's S4 is the competitor to the BMW 335 (and to be fully comparative, the BMW would have to be an X-drive version.)

There is no RS4 (US) available which would be the M3's competitor.

I believe the S4 used to be the M3 rival, but once ""RS's"" were introduced the ""S"" moved a step down the performance ladder.

The net of this is to clarify that the S4 is still in the ELLPS category, no matter how much it can be optioned to (well over $60K in a New York second).

For the record, I wouldn't kick a 335 out of bed for eating crackers -- hell, I'd even bring the crackers.

Perhaps I lucked out with my S4 -- based on the way I equipped it; it seems the ""distance"" between an all singing, all dancing, S-Line A4 and an S4 is remarkably short. If you're looking at an A4 with a bunch of options, the S4 with not so many options, is just a smidge more (on a lease) than the ""lesser"" 4.

My wife's SQ5, Prestige, too, was ""within reach"" of a Q5 3.0T -- and, like the A4 S4 comparison, the ""S"" cars are remarkable, almost thrilling, performers.

The top of the line versions of most of the ELLPS cars are -- almost universally -- great performers available for something far less than a King's ransom. And, what you end up with is very close to the driving fun of a true sports sedan.

Of course, the ""bottom of the line"" of the ELLPS cars is/are still firmly planted as a card carrying member of the ELLPS family. Yet, for folks who frequent these formums and the brand specific sites, my assumption is that very few of us look to the ELLPS brand of our dreams and think, ""I'm gettin' me a strippie . . . ."" My conclusion is that the mavens who are participating here are more likely than not to equip their cars with a lot of performance and tech options -- and probably a fair amount of ""L""uxury features too.

The ELLPS class here on Edmunds, IMHO, has to be one of the most active boards and enjoys the participation of mostly very passionate (and opinionated) car lovers.

Much as I love cars like the S6 (if there are many ""like"" the S6), I think the S4 ""class"" (ELLPS) is really where the action and drama lie.

1201,"October 26, 2014 5:36PM",sweendogy,"Love the @markcincinnati‌ posts - flow so well. I also agree if 60k (msrp on my s4 was 57 and change) for Ellps is now the norm then the s4 (please get the sports diff for the 1k, it works magic) is the machine to beat even in its 5th year. I have to wonder thou what is ELLps- when I was looking at my G 35k was always a number I thought would be entry level lux. I really wonder what exactly is entry level performance and lux- Is it now 40k ? 50k? 60k? If it's over 50k and you are looking be hard pressed to find something better the s4- imo"
1202,"October 26, 2014 5:46PM",dino001,"It's hard to find a legitimate ELLPS below 40 grand. There are some nice ELLS below 40 k, but they lack the ""P"".

1204,"October 26, 2014 6:41PM",sweendogy,@stickguy might have a real point - would add the Q50 and old G37 now q40 to the list as well. Bang for buck plus sudo lux I would find a better car then old g37 that bests fits. Or one could get a used 335 or s4 with a few miles.

1207,"October 31, 2014 11:38AM",flightnurse,"Interesting video, Rick and I started the look for his SUV, and we went to the Volvo dealer and drove a XC60 with the E-Drive engine, this is a Super and Turbo Charged 2 liter engine, rated at 302hp and 295lbs of torque. Just as this video shows, the S60 just walks away from the TLX, as did the XC60 very impressed with the amount power it makes. So for 50K you get a fully loaded top of the line Volvo XC60 that can run with the other guys. I noticed that invoice for this SUV is 48K and people having been paying under invoice for it, also if you do the Euro Delivery you save 5% of the purchase price, PLUS 2 round trip tickets to Sweden, hotel stay (one night) and 15 days of insurance. This sweetens the deal a lot..

We also liked the Q5, a lot, and the 3.0 TDI torque is way addictive, so far the interior of the Q5 is our fave... The X3 was nice, the 2 liter diesel was hard press to complain about the power, We have more SUV's to look at, I'm looking forward in testing the Jeep Grand Cherokee with the diesel engine.

We drove a MDX, we both thought it was nice, but bulky and the lack of customizing made it fall off the list quickly. Now if you are on a budget and looking for a nicely loaded SUV then the MDX is one to look at. While at the dealer we look at the TLX and liked it, Acura did it right..."
1208,"October 31, 2014 12:16PM",markcincinnati,"I would agree with the 2002 observation -- and even agree perhaps for a number of years after 2002; but we're just about at the end of 2014. My point? Things have changed in 12 years.

The 335, the S4 and some incarnation of the Mercedes C class are ELLPS cars based on the places we could logically and appropriately place them.

And, while I am certain you could find ELLPS cars all day long with ""about"" a $40K price tag, it does seem -- now -- that because there is both a stronger ""P"" and ""L""component in the acronym (than 10-12 years ago), that the price of entry has probably crept up to a more realistic level of $45K or more.

As I mentioned, I believe that because folks here on Edmunds are er, more passionate, about cars and they really do want both the P and the L, ""strippies"" of some of the ELLPS cars are probably not what we're opining about here.

Now, along comes the new ELLPS class, perhaps?

What [or, perhaps, WHERE does it belong?] is an A3 or more pointedly an S3? It/they, today, could possibly be argued as deserving a footnote or honorary inclusion into the ELLPS class. But perhaps with the 2016 current ELLPS models looming ""larger"" (perhaps somewhat literally) than today's and certainly larger (for the most part) than the A3 (with its shorter wheelbase and girth), perhaps the entire current membership of the ELLPS family needs to be moved to a newly named forum vacating the ELLPS space thus allowing the A3, S3 and the soon to follow cars from Asia, Europe and the US, to fill in as the NEW NORMAL ELLPS cars.

Of course, if that happens, where does a BMW 3 or Audi A4 or Volvo S60 or TLX, Q50 or, or, or, end up? A 3 series will not be welcome in the LPS forum discussions -- will it? A 3 series is not a 5 series an A4 is not an A6, and so forth.

The lines blur, they come into focus, they blur again; the cars get bigger (almost univerally) every time a new generation is released. A 2014 3 series seems bigger, to me, than a 2003 5 series -- etc etc. So what was true in 2002 just doesn't carry on (my wayward son.)

What's between an ELLPS and an LPS anyway? PPPLPS - Popularly Priced Premium Luxury Performance Sedan (or would that be the step below ELLPS?) Or perhaps UMLPS - Updwardly Mobile Luxury Performance Sedan? Maybe NQQFBLPS - Not Quite Qualified to be a Full Blown Luxury Performance Sedan. No no, how 'bout ILLPS in keeping with the ""E"" for Entry -- we bump it up to: Intermediate Level Luxury Performance Sedan, and we move the current ELLPS players into the ILLPS class and move the up and coming ""Jr ELLPS's"" of today into the void left by moving the current folks from ELLPS to ILLPS and so on . . .

Yeah, that's the ticket.

Almost forgot: Boo! Happy Halloween!"

I was surprised that the rear had the amount of legroom it had, but the head to roof test was the problem.

1211,"October 31, 2014 2:35PM",stickguy,"I meant 60, since that is what you said you drove. Freudian slip I guess.

I find the RDX to be roomy enough up front, and I am not small, nor is my wife. But it does have a very large back seat.

Headroom? First I heard anyone complain about that on the RDX. I normally have issues (large Torso to leg ratio!), and some cars like the 2001 TL I just could not drive without my head jammed in the roof. But I don't come close to hitting in the RDX.

Oh well. that is why they make so many cars. Just have to find what works for you. The RDX at least is a bargain compared to the Euro ones."

1213,"October 31, 2014 3:20PM",stickguy,"My wife wanted the nice blue badly, but they only offered it on the MDX. The dark gray we got is nice though, and we have the tan interior. Gray would have been nice too."
1214,"October 31, 2014 3:21PM",markcincinnati,"The RDX is FWD biased and currently can't be had with what used to be the RDX's secret sauce, SH-AWD. The RDX is certainly nice looking and is, as noted, high content for the money.

It is, however, an appliance, a very good appliance but rather unremarkable if you are looking for anything beyond modest (and I think that is generous) performance.

The RDX, like all Acura's is probably one of the most reliable and I would, therefore, assume durable vehicles in the small to mid size CUV universe.

Life, as I now know, being north of 60, is too short for boring cars.

My vote would be for the X3 of the choices suggested -- but I did much appreciate the XC60 T6 when I floored the accelerator -- the thing has some serious torque, the X3 (at the price point) couldn't even come close.

The X3 however felt like it was on rails.

Here is the test I use -- I find a curve on a secondary road -- a very lightly traveled secondary road. I look for a curve marked 15mph or 20mph (at most). Then I approach the curve at more than double the posted speed; next I brake hard for a moment to reduce speed to double the posted speed and to force a weight transfer to the front wheel. As I enter the curve at 30mph, I accelerate hard as soon as the front wheels have passed the mid point of the curve.

If the car easily remains in its lane, I repeat the process at triple the posted speed.

The X3 easily handles this ""experiment"" and the feeling is that it could go at the corner at more than 3x the posted ""suggested"" speed. The RDX (old version with the turbo 4 and SH-AWD could do this all day.) The new one plows and crosses the center line. The XC60 was a T6 Type R and it felt in good control of its understeering urges too. But the Volvo was much closer to its limit since it didn't shift enough power aft since there technically was no actual loss of traction.

The X3 was the natural -- were money no object, the X3 with the i6 turbo would clearly be the one to get if you wanted some salt and pepper on your ""meat."""
1215,"October 31, 2014 3:28PM",stickguy,"well, as always, money comes into play. Big difference between stretching from a ""normal"" CUV to an RDX in the low-mid 30s, and jumping to a European hot rod for 50k+, if not pushing 60 large.

Modest performance? If you mean acceleration, given that it does 0-60 in the low 6's, you have some awfully high standards! We obviously travel in different automotive standard circles!"

1219,"November 1, 2014 7:38AM",markcincinnati,"Simply put, the SQ5 -- even at its price point -- offered more content, the immpeccable interior Audi seems to do with aplomb, and oh that supercharged engine with zero lag, weapons grade torque -- and the SQ5 had a gorgeous red leather interior to boot.

To get the same or similar content, the BMW was even more expensive; and I think she felt the SQ5's interior, sport seats in particular plus the B&O sound system cinched it -- almost. Panther Black Pearl paint sealed the deal. That plus a 6% discount on NOT your garden variety Q5 or X3 -- Audi iimbues its ""S"" cars with ""that certain something"" -- undoubtedly sealed the deal.

Having matching interiors was probably a minor influencer, too.

She has had 2 X3's since 2005 -- very fond of them. But, if you've never driven an SQ5 at full cry, you may not quite understand the almost immediate reaction: An ""addiction"" to the sound and the fury, wrapped up in what seems to be a premium CAR -- the BMW for all of its inherent goodness just doesn't seem as nice of a place to spend hours in. Then, of course, there is that oh-so-cute flat bottomed sport steering wheel on the SQ, too.

If you can take an SQ5 out for a test drive.

On the other hand . . .

The BMW is better balanced -- but the SQ passes the triple speed around the curve test with ease and poise. As a practical matter, that attribute felt pretty much like a draw, despite the BMW's less heavy nose. The Audi engineers did a very nice job taming the potetial understeer of the SQ's fatter front-end.

Just test drive an SQ -- perhaps you too will want to keep on driving it, long aafter the test drive ends. One more thing, the SQ5 is very rare, you won't see yourself coming and going -- the X3 even with the more potent i6 motivation is rather easy to find, and unlike the SQ seems to do little to differentiate itself from the ""regular"" X3."

1223,"November 2, 2014 12:54PM",markcincinnati,"And the punchline is: ""He Only Took Tips!""

A tip for those who are either owners of or contemplating one of these ELLPS or ELLPSUV/CUV's -- assuming the vehicle in question is not a BMW.

Here goes: many, probably most of these cars tend toward -- or outright already have -- some degree of nose heaviness. Audi is certainly not known for ""50 - 50"" weight balance, for instance. Acura, Volvo and most certainly others (again not BMW) are absolutely nose heavy when configured as 2WD vehicles (since they mostly are FWD when ordered thusly). More and more of these ELLP vehicles are ordered every year with 4-driven wheels (the up take here in SW Ohio is now for ""mostly"" AWD versions -- even most BMW's and Mercedes are acquired with AWD so say the dealers). Alas, even the AWD versions are nose-heavy.

The thing that I've learned that is a quick, easy and virtually free way to improve upon some of the effects of being a bit porky on the front is to inflate the front tires +2 pounds more than the rear tires; and, typically to inflate the fronts to one or two pounds MORE than the factory sticker suggests.

My S4 says to inflate the tires at max to 42 pounds. I inflate front to 43 and rear to 41 (using the free nitrogen ""air"" Costco offers its members).

We had a cold snap here in River City yesterday -- of course the air pressure in all four tires dropped dramatically -- we went from 70+ degrees to overnight temps in the upper teens with a daytime high an optimistic 41.

Since I was at Costco getting my fill up of their Top-Tier premium, I also went for the free air fill-up. Based on the length of time before the ""ding"" indicating 43 pounds, the pressure had to have been over 5 or 6 pounds below that.

To ensure the tires were cold, I drove to Costco, parked and went shopping in the store for a while, then went to the tire dept for my fill-up.

I kid you not -- and I've known this for years, yet I was as pleasantly surprised as could be -- the turn-in was IMMEDIATELY sharper, like the car had been placed on a set of shiny new rails.

OK, that is the ""free"" (as in almost zero cost) tip.

Here's one, that when coupled with the above free tip, will further dramatically improve your heavy nosed (and this one works on any car) ELLP vehicle's steering dynamics: switching out of the factory tires (unless certain tires are already on your ELLP car) into the top of the line performance tires in the class (of tire) that you would normally drive.

For example -- here in SW Ohio -- no one (well, virtually no one) uses ""summer"" and ""winter"" tires -- they use either ""summer"" tires year round or (more likely) all-season tires, year round.

The Germans have even gone so far as to specify as no cost options, typically, the ability to order your car with summer only or all season rubber. Dealers typically order their for-stock vehicles with all-season rubber to keep their customers from complaining about the super fast tire wear and the almost unusable traction summer tires offer to those of us who do have temps that go below 40 - 45 degrees from time to time (our typical winters are usually above freezing, but usually below 45 which is the kryptonite temp for summer only tires).

The thing is, a lot of the ""all-season"" tires are either Grand Touring tires or are simply H rated all-seasons (generally from a well-known brand and generally with a fairly long tread-life expectation).

My S4 came with H rated Grand Touring tires. What were they thinking? Offered up to order is an S4 with either summer or all-season tires. I checked the all-season box since, well, you know, I live in Cincinnati and we really (usually) have very mild winters in terms of both temp and snowfall. Why do I need dedicated winter tires in my climate, so to speak?

I don't.

Grand Touring tires are fine -- but, if you ax' me they have no business on an Audi S car of any stripe.

What is better -- much much better? Easy-peasy: an Ultra-High Performance All-Season tire from one of the name brands all of the German's buy from. We ended up with Continental ExtremeContact DWS Ultra High Performance All-Seasons from Tire Rack -- shipped to the dealer, installed and road-force balanced. These tires should have their picture placed beside the word ""sticky"" in your Merriam-Webster.

They have super-stiff (compared to the rather comfy-biased Grand Touring H rated rubber that the S4 came with) sidewalls and they are Y speed-rated. Of course, since I ordered my car with the all-season tire option, Audi saw fit to engage a max-speed limiter that tops out at 130 (easily switched off, if you really think you're going to need to exceed 130MPH).

So, you can, for relatively little money (close to zero) noticeably improve your ELLP's turn-in, gas mileage and overall handling by simply cranking up the fronts to +2 pounds over the rears and by cranking up the front 1 or 2 pounds over the door jam's ""suggestion.""

Then for what will probably amount to $700 to $1,000 all-in (but for some of these cars that you can order 20"" wheels, the $ amount will be higher), you can take the next big step and get rid of the almost certainly ""wimpy"" tires the manufacturers seem to put on these cars when the ""no summer only"" tire option is checked.

Virtually all of these ELLPS, ELLPSUV/CUV vehicles are nose heavy -- which manifests itself as under-steer. It is unlikely you can, as the saying goes, put lipstick on a pig and turn it into a Porsche in the handling department -- but, with my hand raised on high, I can attest that by doing both of the suggested tips above, I even transformed my TL Advance from somewhat of a farm-implement (i.e., it could tend to ""plow"" a little bit even with SH-AWD) due to its less than ideal 60-40 (or something like that) F/R weight distribution) into a confidence inspiring and -- with a consideration for its price -- ""S4-light"" ELLPS.

Of course, in the case of the Acura TL Advance w/SH-AWD the 19"" H rated tires that it came with couldn't have sucked anymore even if their name was Hoover (I crack myself up).

So, my friends and fellow posters, if you're laying out something north of $45,000, you can for no to relatively low money transform your baby from ""nice"" to a vehicle that, quoting my wife, ""goes like a snake in a rat hole.""

If you play your cards right, you can make the UHP all-seasons (or whatever you and your ""climate"" could call optimum) part of the purchase/lease deal when you order the car or before you sign on the dotted line to buy/lease one off the lot.

Hopefully the above will have some merit and even more $ value and most of all ""fun to drive"" value for at least one forum participant.

Drive it . . . oh hell, you know the rest."

""Michelin has reset the performance standard for an all-season tire with their Pilot Sport A/S 3, which delivers impressive handling in both dry and wet conditions. And while not apparent during our short road evaluation, when running laps on our test track at the limit this tire showed a little more tread wear than the others tires. But this focus on ultimate performance during the summer months compromises its wintertime capabilities somewhat. The Bridgestone Potenza RE970AS Pole Position is a pleasure to drive, with a satisfying feel in the steering wheel and good handling in dry and wet conditions. However, it falls way short of what most drivers would consider adequate in winter conditions. The Continental ExtremeContact DWS doesn't quite have the nimble feel of the others, but offers good ride quality and reasonable handling along with good overall traction regardless of the weather - dry, wet or winter.""

I found the above @: http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tests/testDisplay.jsp?ttid=177

Now, having lived about 20,000 miles with the Contis DWS Ultra High Performance -- in Cincinnati's climate -- I would not hesitate to ""go again"" with the Contis.

If I lived perhaps 100 miles or so due south of Cincinnati, the Michelin Pilot Sport A/S 3's would certainly vie for my dollars.

The further north I might live, however, the Conti DWS UHP's would still be the ones to beat based on the Tire Rack review. The review does tend to make me think the DWS's are much more of a compromise than anything else, but they are much stiffer than the standard GT Contis that came with my S4, very quiet and they do improve the handling of the car as noted in my post regarding air pressure and tires.

It would appear that the Michelin's are the new standard in UHP all seasons, but the review seems to suggest they are not as all year round good as the Continentals.

It's great to have such excellent choices."

My original point was to suggest tips that would improve your (our) lot in life -- if we live in a place that has moderate winters or in a city that mitigates the impact of snow with super human snow removal and lots of road chemicals.

Were I a resident of, say, Minnesota or North Dakota or perhaps even Michigan, I may feel the need for four dedicated winter shoes.

Were I the type to really push my car (S or no) to more than 85%, perhaps that too would argue in favor of summer MAX Performance tires (my 2009 A4 did come with MAX performance 35 series 19"" x 255's -- they lasted 11,000 miles).

I like to drive somewhat at a higher level than, I assume, most US drivers. I have a car that allows me to be a better driver than I probably am (in real life); I have been to 4 Audi driving schools in Austria, one Porsche school in little ol' Dayton, Ohio and a BMW X-drive school in South (and North) Carolina.

I have the schoolin' and the car to get 'er done -- therefore, I find my skills and my car to be under-tired with the mostly crappy all-seasons manufacturers foist upon Americans who (mostly like me) don't do what you two do.

I am lobbying the manufacturers (Audi in my case) to consider stepping up to UHP A/S's rather than the much lower ""performance"" rubber most manufacturers shod their cars with when the customer orders ""non-Summer"" tires.

I take my hat off to your two who are willing and able to not go for the optimum, rather electing to go for the maximum you can get, even if it means changing your wheels and tires out twice per year.

For those who aren't willing to walk the walk (that would be me) of the twice yearly ritual, all I am hoping to convey is that there is a much much better performing car waiting to be let loose if you will at least upgrade to UHP A/S;s rather than not even know what you're missing.

You two, indeed, drive it like you live. I applaud your behavior but I'm still OK with mine.

You might say, and I do, that good is the enemy of great. In this case, I'll say what I am looking for is to graduate from good to very good -- which still remains the enemy of greatness, but in this instance, I, for one, am willing to live with it."

The cost to swap is not cheap when also buying another set of rims along with the cost of tires. The goodyear a/s UHP I had on the G - they did the trick just fine. They def rode a little harsher then the standard G tires and were better in the sun- but the G on the old set (when new) was better in the snow with the standard non UHP - a/s.

Here goes:
=====

I'll stick with the A3 & A4 to introduce a new forum class for ""LPS"" [suffix'd] cars.

For the moment, let's say the ELLPS class is solidly where the new A3 belongs, To me, that seems to suggest the A4 (and the 2016 A4 leaps to mind) is no longer an ELLPS, nor is it an LPS, since the A6 is the representative of the LPS entry from Audi.

Well, two LPS classes used to be sufficient -- but over the past few years car companies have scrambled to ""find a hole"" in the market and create a new car model to plug it. And, no hole seems either too big or too little -- model proliferation is the norm these days.

Audi and BMW (and Mercedes too) have become the masters of model proliferation, it seems.

And, just about ""everybody"" demonstrates ""wheelbase"" [or overall length] and girth growth every time they birth the new generation of a model. The BMW 3, for instance, has grown so much so that it is, in many ways, larger than a not-that-old 5 series. The current A4 used to be the size of the new A3 -- and when the current A4 was introduced in the US as a 2009 model it's wheelbase was within a fraction of an inch of the size of the then current A6. I know, I had a 2005 A6 that I kept for 6 months after the lease ended so that I could move to the new A4 and not have any period of time where I was not in an Audi. When the 2009 A4 came in to the dealer, I pulled my A6 up beside it -- and it was virtually impossible to tell the difference between the two with respect to wheelbase.

The A4 got big! Then, when the new gen A6 came out, it, of course, grew in size -- the A3 was in the pipeline (not the 2009 A3, which was essentially a VW) and what we have in the brand new A3 is a car that plugs the hole left by the move up of the A4 into what used to be the size class of the A6, Numerous examples of this phenomenon can be cited for the cars that come from BMW, Mercedes, Cadillac and Lexus.

We now have -- at least -- 3 size (and price) categories for cars to fit into and still be, in some fashion (class) LPS cars. ELLPS, ILLPS & LPS is my proposal.

ILLPS means Intermediate Level LPS also known as a member of the phylum: Luxoperforiososedantis.

So, assuming we all accept the notion that three LPS classes are now appropriate, we move the current (and certainly 2016's upcoming) A4, 3 series and C class (while were sticking with the Germans) to the ILLPS forum and open up the new, 'blank slate', ELLPS board (forum) for cars like the new Audi A3, BMW 2 series (which may be problematic since it doesn't have 4-doors as far as I know) and the Mercedes CLA (which is a 4-door coupe, according to MB). We move the CTS firmly to the LPS forum and put the ATS in with the ILPS cars if its wheelbase (among other things) doesn't force it into the ELLPS class.

I would think wheelbase would be one criteria, total length and width of the car two additional criteria, base price and 90% maximum price yet an additional criteria, and so forth.

Which brings me to perception.

I cannot -- YET -- place the Hyundai Genesis (for example) in the mix of LPS anything; however, there is a strong resemblance to some of the phylum's class members at least insofar as luxury content is concerned. I would assume the Genesis will be an LPS member someday.

Perhaps time in the market is a criteria -- no one wants a poser -- and it takes time to earn your place in phylum Luxoperforiososedantis.

In any case, the time has come for the current ELLPS suspects to move to the ILLPS forum.

At least I think so."

Went to the Audi dealer 3 weeks ago to test drive a Q7 and wound up driving the S6. WOW

What's your thoughts on the 2015, S6. Test drove the car twice really impressed with it. Nothing comes close to the excitement with this bad boy. My only problem is interior room getting in and out and the 80k price.

The S6 I drove on the lot had the 19' tires. Handling and taking turns were incredible. I want to upgrade to 20' tire and rims. I like that whole look but I'm afraid I may lose some of the ride and handling/ . Dealer claims I wont notice much of a difference. Thoughts."

In regards to the Q7, we are looking at the Q5, and have test driven a VW Touareg which is equal to the Q7 in size. We liked it, but VW has really dummy downed the Touareg as far as equipment goes. Nav is not in the same league, voice control the same issue, but the fit and finish was on par with Audi."

1274,"November 25, 2014 6:35PM",markcincinnati,"Some quick (for me) follow ups:

Equipped pretty much to the max, the SQ5 (Prestige) will be in the $60's. A ""nicely equipped,"" but hardly Porsche equipped pretty much to the max will be close to $10K more. My Audi dealer says the Porsche will be almost $15K more ""similarly"" loaded.

I don;t know how accurate that latter claim is, but the Macan S can easily go well into the $70's and the Macan Turbo can pass $100K -- but it will be about a half second quicker than the S and the SQ5.

The US SQ5 is also sold only with a set ground clearance, and the Macan is both lower and can be had with an adjustable suspension.

Those who want more headroom, too, will consider the SQ5 since its proportions are more generous for rear seat passengers and their stuff. I thought the two cars were redundant, and I can still convince myself of that, but I can also see the Macan appealing to a different audience, but then, at the price, the Macan is now able to actually be more expensive than a Cayenne.

I'd test them both unless you have a specific purpose that only one or the other fulfills.

The SQ5 does have more HP and torque, and an 8 speed non-dsg transmission -- to the Macan's 7-spd PDK.

Both are very fine examples of excess -- in a CUV suit. We have 25,000 miles on our SQ5 -- and would get another in a heartbeat and we have driven both cars; we like the higher ground clearance of the Audi and the nearly $10,000 lower price is a plus too.

The S6, at its price, doesn't seem to have an analog from the other Germans. The BMW 535 doesn't even come close and the 550 isn't as sticky as the S6 (thanks to quattro).

I can't really call the S6 a bargain, but it does offer the buyer more content for the MSRP than the BMW. I'd avoid the 20"" wheels, but that is a personal choice.

I floored the S6 and counted to 3 -- when I looked down I had gone beyond 100MPH from about 60. Nothing I've driven (other than a Corvette) even comes a little bit close.

The S6, to me, seems just a bit too big, just like my S4 seems a bit too small -- so I look forward to a larger S4, although the S6 is my ""lust for"" car.

The least talked about ""car"" if you axe me, is the SQ5 -- it is a vehicle that deserves a bit more exposure. Too bad the Macan is likely to steal the show, being that it is, after all, a Porsche."
1275,"November 26, 2014 3:15PM",brian125,"When I was at the Audi dealership I was talking to a guy getting a oil change on his SQ5. Absolutely loves this vehicle. Claims the ride and handling is phenomenal. price tag was up there thou. Didn't actually see one there.

I find the S6 a little smaller inside for me. At 6'1 with 2 back surgery's under my belt and weighting closer to a quarter pounder with cheese area these days Car size, getting in and out is priority. In a perfect world I would love the S8 interior dimensions in the size of a S-6 but with a S6 price tag. That being said my dilemma which probably is not a bad one is replacing my 13, R-spec Genesis for a S6, or trading my 2012, BMW X-5 with 30k miles and buying the Q-7.

I originally went to dealership to test drive the Q7 and wound up driving a 2015, S-6. I Love this vehicle or lust for it............ maybe both.. This car is the total package. So I'm either going for 2 shots in the ribs for a Hyundai trade in or 1 hard slap in the face for the X-5. I'm hoping my golf buddy takes my X-5 off my hands. Then my decision will be a lot easier.

Such problems around the holidays for us car lovers. Probably why strokes are up holiday time."
1276,"December 1, 2014 10:08AM",markcincinnati,"Long (food-centric) holiday weekends are for cooking, dining out (and over eating), going to places in your city you haven’t been to for years, movies, more movies . . . and test driving new cars (regardless of the possibility you would ever buy one).

The following list of – hopefully descriptive – terms, apply to the latter activity, or better said apply as descriptive terms of the test-driven car, this past Friday (the day after the food coma).

Clarification of the terms, that is how they may be applied, is noted (in parentheses):

-Aroused (you don’t start this car, you press the button on the console and it is “aroused”)

-Audacious

-Bland-looking (dashboard)

-Brutish

-Close (front seat)

-Cramped (back seat)

-Crude-ish

-Dart-y

-Expensive (unfortunately, equipped as it apparently needs to be equipped, it is easily 10-15% too much money for a car that has luxury intentions but doesn’t deliver much luxury despite its long list of features)

-Fast (as in, “How fast would you like to go sir, I can manage 150 if that would be sufficient.”)

-Firm (harsh-es kinder gentler side; this car is capable of firm only on the smoothest of road surfaces and/or above 85MPH)

-Fun (to drive for relatively short distances)

-Harsh (on secondary roads you are punished over every patched pot-hole you drive over, pounded by every expansion joint you meet and slammed when you drive over the various undulations presented by our aging highway infrastructure)

-Jittery (think hum while strumming your lips)

-Loud (road noise, wind noise is minimal)

-Minimalist (the large expanse of black plastic on the section of the dash in front of the passenger isn’t exactly cheap looking, no, it’s not that, it just looks boring, unimaginative, perhaps like there is some carbon fiber or brushed aluminum trim piece that was accidentally omitted)

-Nervous (the car, not me)

-Nimble (turns like a go-kart)

-Noisy (not much isolation from the engine or the road – makes conversation at speed require LOUD TONES even for the two front-seat passengers; I could imagine it would require yelling for back-seat passengers to hear or to be heard)

-Powerful (not quite OMG, but very much like a two-year old V8 Mustang, in fine tune)

-Precise (I imagine it feels like a Swiss watch, if you could actually drive one, that is)

-Punishing (see harsh above, but add to it a couple of kidney punches thrown in just so you don’t get the impression this car could be, in any way, considered supple)

-Quality (the feel of the switchgear is like a German chef’s knife in your hand – makes other knives (and other cars) feel just a tad bit of a lesser tool)

-Quick (dart-y could have sufficed, and “quick” is not the same as “fast” – this car is seriously quick at 0-62 in 4.7 seconds)

-Raucous (the road and tire noise would argue against a cross-country trip in this car)

-Raw (I guess I need to point out that it is also – in some ways – refined (see below), at least in terms of the power-train)

-Refined (the fit and finish are great, the doors close with nary even a hint of a tinny sound, everything is solid)

-Responsive

-Rough (you probably could have deduced this by now, but I need you to know that this only applies to the ride – the engine is like buttah)

-Sensitive (have you ever seen an old movie about a safe-cracker; you know the guy who sandpapers his fingertips before he begins turning the dial – his fingertips are sooo sensitive he can “feel” the tumblers falling into place; well, this car is sanded fingertips sensitive)

-Slick (the transmission, although “only” a six-speed, this transmission mates nicely with the smooth, powerful engine)

-Smooth (the engine)

-Solid (like a brick, you know what)

-Sonorous (the engine – ok, here’s a preliminary reveal – you would not be blamed if you thought this engine was a 6 or 8 cylinder with an old-fashioned air-sucking, honking wildly, air-intake; but you’d be wrong, this engine is the devil’s own 4-banger, avert your eyes, carry garlic cloves and cover yourself with wolfs bane just in case)

-Stiff (harsh-es kinder, gentler, cousin)

-Sublime (the seats are so good in this car they could almost make you forget its boy-racer characteristics)

-Tense (this thing is really on-edge once it is put in gear)

-Tight (jam up and jelly tight – I never knew what that meant in the song, but it seems to fit here)
[I've been told Jam up and Jelly tight is a sexual reference, so I'll let it stand]

-Tiring (again, lovely car to drive about 20 miles, maybe even 25 miles; just not the kind of thing you’d want to take long trip – even of a 100 miles – in repeatedly. . . you’d just be worn out from the, er, Sturm und Drang

-Twitchy

-Urgent

-Unyielding

-Violent

-Visceral

-Wearying (see tiring – in short this is a $50,000 go-kart; and, there is nothing wrong with that, but I think, given the car’s lack of Premium-ness, I’d go for the Subie WRX and pocket the difference).

Much to like, a bit less not to like, but overall “at these prices” you do have the choice of giving yourself kidney punches and endure about the same cacophony (maybe less, even) in the Subaru WRX.

The car in question?

A 2015 Audi S3 with the Prestige and Sport packages, plus the upgraded seats, trim and premium paint.

I so wanted to love this car – and I must compliment Audi on figuring out how to make a 4 cylinder growl and snarl -- and yes I know it is partially the work of the audio system, but who cares? (all the while being as smooth as silk) like a Mustang V8 (circa 2012) – but the thing, as fun as it is to drive for a relatively short distance, just doesn’t feel like it is a Premium Class car (beyond the interlocking 4 rings on the front and rear) – it feels like what I imagine Subaru is shooting for and largely doing (but for a lot less money) with their current WRX's.

The Audi’s 19” wheels and tires may well be the culprit, but the almost total lack of sound deadening (well, OK, not really) just doesn’t do it for me (especially when the thing is north of $50K). Getting out of an S3 and then driving off in an S4 is like night and day. The S4 may be more isolated, better at mastering road imperfections and designed to press your kidneys rather than punch them, and that’s what makes even the “old” tech 2015 S4 still a bunch more car for just a little more money and the S4 actually feels and looks like the 4-rings suggest it ought to feel and look like.

Oh, BTW, the S3 has fantastic LED headlights – and the thing is a looker. But $50,000+? Nah.

1302,"December 9, 2014 3:23PM",markcincinnati,"You may know that my wife and I, after decades of German only, went with an Infiniti and an Acura (2011 and 2012 respectively). She kept her 39 month lease vehicle 35 months and I kept my 36 month lease TL SH- AWD Advance 25 months.

These cars, hers an FX and mine a TL were stickered at a combined $97K. The leases had to have been subvented by the mfgrs and the cars were reliable (and I assume durable) and well made with several obvious (and successful) attempts to move them upscale from their Nissan and Honda lineage. Perhaps for the right money -- and it would have to be seriously inexpensive -- a new TL, Q or IS (I actually ordered the Lexus IS-350AWD F-Sport) might have made it into our garage.

Since we test drive cars almost as a hobby, we were really -- this time -- able to see how far the Germans had come since our last German cars, hers a 2008 BMW, mine a 2009 Audi. The differences, now, at this point of inflection are, once again in favor of the Germans.

My wife puts it this way, ""The Japanese cars are 'competent' appliances -- but they ain't got no soul."" This from a person with one undergrad and two graduate level degrees (one of them a JD) who hates it when improper grammar is used.

The hell of it is, her description is perfect -- in tone, tenor and accuracy. The Germans, today at least, have indeed again found that certain something that can best be described as soul. And, the money (when leased) is no longer an excuse to 'settle' for the more or less soul-less vehicles currently marketed by the big-3 Japanese ELLPS and LPS providers.

Frankly, even the new Volvo products bear a good long look.

Our guess is the Japanese premium cars may offer higher durability scores, but even that seems not to be the case as my wife's SQ5 Prestige now is approaching 30K miles and still feels new. We'll see if this new car smell (so to speak) remains at 50K, but things look good."
1303,"December 9, 2014 9:51PM",flightnurse,"Mark, we are looking at a SUV for Rick, and at the Phoenix Auto Show 2 weeks ago, it was nice to have all the SUV's in one room so to speak to take a look at them all. So far the BMW X3 and Audi Q5 are the two top contenders. At the Auto Show we looked at the MB GLA, GLK, and ML. The GL is just too big (this is Ricks words, not mine.) the GLA I was impressed with, but too small, the GLK was too small, the ML I found to be just right. What I found interesting with the ML was, the faux leather in it looked and felt real, and the contrasting stitching made the interior look more upper class. We test drove a ML250 with the new 2.1l diesel engine, I was not impressed at all with the engine, lots of turbo lag and the engine did not feel refined like the Audi or BMW. But the size was just right, slightly bigger then the Audi and BMW, but smaller then the X5 and Q7.

At the Auto show we looked at the Infiniti QX60 and was surprised on how there isn't much of a difference between the dash of the QX60 and Pathfinder, lots of Nissan switch gear in it, for almost 20K price difference between the two Nissan needs to not use parts bin parts (nissan) in the infiniti."
1304,"December 10, 2014 10:11AM",graphicguy,"Mark....I think overall, the quality and competence of today's cars are so far removed (better) from where they were even 5 short years ago is a pretty big gulf.

I look at my former TL SH AWD and remember what the first one I drove of the current gen was like. Not sure what Acura did, but it was clear they had tweaked the suspension, updated to electronics, and numerous and sundry other things in the ensuing years up until the TLX came out. Most of what they did, you couldn't see. You could sure feel it in the way the car handled, the way it rode, the way it steered, the way the electronics responded, etc.

I have a CTS now. It iOS light years ahead of anything I've looked at recently....from the way it drives, the way it handles, the way it rides, the quality of materials, the careful assembly, the paint with lustrous, no orange peel effect, etc.

Over in the sales/purchase threads, there are lots of discussions about how much Mercedes has changed over the last 5 years. I know for a fact that the E92 BMW I had has been changed immeasurably (some say improved, some say not) vs the F3x versions.

Given your experience with the S4 vs my experience with the S4, it sounds like Audi quietly addressed their (what I considered major) issues.

The march of technology and performance in cars over the last few years is nothing short of breathtaking."
1305,"December 10, 2014 10:38PM",nyccarguy,"A car we often don't speak of in here is the Lexus IS. We all know the volume selling IS 250 AWD's acceleration numbers are lackluster and the IS 350's high 5s 0-60 times won't win you too many bragging rights on the Internet. The IS 350 F-Sport version has some positives going for it.

Power train - the 3.5L V6 has remained essentially unchanged since 2006 as has the 6-Speed Automatic still found in the AWD version. The RWD has an 8-Speed automatic (maybe it can't handle the AWD?). It is old school for sure, especially compared to the other 4cyl turbos in the class, but tried & true none the less.

Body - yes you can call the IS polarizing. It's grille even looks like The Predator. It's looks are very modern. The car does stand out in a crowd of ubiquitous 320s, 328s, C300s, & Audi A4s. I like the charcoal, split 5 Spoke wheels.

Adaptive Suspension - many of today's ELLPS are too soft in their base form and too harsh with their sport suspensions. The IS350 F Sport has an adaptive suspension that constantly monitors and adjusts each shock absorber.

Now back in 2006, I attended a Lexus test drive event and was able to drive an IS350 back to back with an E90 330i. Now the IS was MUCh faster (butt Dyno), but BMW took care of that in 2007 with the twin turbo 335i. I thought the BMW was a better driving car (brakes, steering, suspension). Things are different today. The BMW still puts up good numbers (328i & 335i), but they have also gotten softer and are much less engaging to drive. Maybe the playing field has evened out."
1306,"December 10, 2014 11:40PM",roadburner,"The emphasis has shifted from driving dynamics to technology- either entertainment or electronic nannies. I guess that's understandable; 99% of buyers in this segment believe that ""trailing throttle oversteer"" is a band that used to open for Cheap Trick and think ""contact patches"" are used to help you quit smoking..."
1307,"December 11, 2014 7:21AM",markcincinnati,"Roadburner -- you crack me up! Of course the Cheap Trick quip suggests you've been around the sun quite a few times (as have I).

Two of my friends (one is an aunt) acquired new ELLPS (1 Lexus and 1 Infiniti) cars. One of these folks (who will remain otherwise unidentified) was going from one city to another about 30 miles apart. The call to me proclaimed ""the GPS lady gives incorrect instructions"" -- and my friend ended up in a city some 60 miles in the wrong direction.

Now, I have had numerous GPS systems, my first in 2001. I have had the experience where the GPS lady did indeed provide incorrect directions (but I still arrived at my destination, just with a long detour). The last time I had a car provide wrong directions was in 2004.

The ""science"" of GPS technology and the map makers themselves have improved greatly is the point. Or perhaps the point is the GPS lady was not wrong -- and if you would have followed her directions you would not be 60 miles out of the way.

I said nothing to my friend.

I am thinking I will suggest a return visit to the dealership for a ""training class"" on the marvelous tech these Japanese cars afford. Of course, my other friend was unaware of the car's sat radio tuner and when I turned the radio to the sat band and found Classic Vinyl, my friend was amazed -- no commercials and tons of music.

Analogy: Maybe we've reached the point where CD's and iPods or iPhones (for music) are good enough and DVD-Audio despite its amazing quality, is just not worth it to most folks.

I remember, too, Sprint spent a ton of money on the sound quality of their network only to find people would rather have fewer dropouts than hi-fi sound from their cell phone network.

These cars have lots of tech, to be sure -- but other than the folks reading and writing here on Edmunds, I wonder who is actually using automatic cruise control, lane keeping, in-car Internet and even google earth (which is, at least, pretty cool to play with even if it is not really all that practical).

Have we reached some kind of saturation? Or are we all collectively waiting for ""Jarvis"" (in the Iron Man suit) to mature to the point where we don't have to learn anything to program our GPS other than to say ""I wanna go to Austin and avoid the Interstates.""

I'm back to wanting the performance of an S4 with the ride of an A8 -- that plus an upgraded sound system and I'd be fine. The current gen of GPS and the other tech is probably acceptable to folks like you and me, since we actually (apparently) take the time to learn to program it.

I'm clearly not waiting on Jarvis, but he can't get here soon enough."
1308,"December 11, 2014 7:49AM",graphicguy,"Mark....interesting take, as always.

I think some of the safety nannies fall in the category, ""we had the sensors on the compute power. So, it was easy to do""....by the manufacturers.

I do like lane departure warning. Not so much the ""Lane Keep"" features. I have front end collision mitigation which I'll assume works, as I don't want to test it out.

GPS in cars is to the point where the ones I've used are extremely accurate. I expect that's a feature that will come with just about all cars in the not so distant future, given most have a ""cutout"" that was engineered in the dash for some sort of screen.

At some point I'm waiting to hear of the drunk guy who was pulled over for crossing a yellow line and got a DUI. His defense will be ""no way...I had lane keep feature on my car. There's no way that's possible."" Maybe RB can comment on the legalities of such a scenario.

It amazes me how far suspension technology has come. I now own a CTS with Magnetic Ride Control. It's pretty darn amazing. Aside from the car having nearly ideal weight distribution and weight reduction, the MRC keeps the wheels planted while the body stays tight, and the ride is superb.....kind of what you were talking about with an A8.

About DVD-As....I have a bunch of them. They are amazing sounding. Used to love listening to them in the car. No longer. I don't know of any cars that can play them in all their surround sound glory anymore.

So, I play them at home (where they sound even better). But, no one in my family just sits to listen to music any more. It's always a ""background"" activity."
1309,"December 11, 2014 8:10AM",dino001,"I was recently browsing local inventory of BMW and Benz dealers. One thing jumped on me - new C-class is in stock in good number - NOT A SINGLE unit with leather seat in multiple dealerships. Even upscale C400. All have MB-Tex. BMW on the other hand - majority of 328 and up has premium package, which is leather. I really don't get it, especially that C-class is supposed to go ""upmarket"" as CLA filled the entry point. There are units there well in $50K+ and still no leather. I don't know - is that plastic MB-Tex so good? I just find it hard to believe... Not to mention that not a single one?"
1310,"December 11, 2014 8:24AM",carnaught,In my experience the MB-Tex is so good that the only major difference to me is that the leather is more aromatic. Tex may be actually more durable but I have no anecdotal or other proof of this.

The PLEATHER seats unlike real leather doesn't or can't breathe. Of course with modern seat ventilation technology, that may be less of an issue.

I'm still of the ""leather is better"" opinion -- but I remember ONE TIME ordering a new Audi 5000CS turbo quattro with wool seats (leather was standard and wool was a special order at no cost option). These seats, in many ways, were the most comfortable ever. Not cold in winter, not hot in summer (mine were heated, too).

The issue, with gray seats, was dirt. Well, OK, not ""dirt dirt"" but coffee, mustard, coke and other drinks, ice cream droppings and, I would imagine all sorts of other messes should one have kids in the car. A good old french fry stain would be a heart breaker.

Now, I did put sheepskin seat covers on the front buckets -- and that helped. But as good as the wool seats were, I was one and done.

I have no doubt MB-Tex is good fake leather, or faux leather -- but give me the real thing."

As for crossing the center line and the lane keep feature? It would depend on the individual case, and the competence of the judge and counsel. Me, I'd probably let the defendant argue that- assuming he could prove his car had that feature.

As an aside, the judiciary has one of the highest automotive illiteracy rates of virtually any profession. A couple of judges in my district would take voluminous notes if they were hearing a case involving vehicle repairs, etc., take the case under submission, and give the notes to me so that I could sift the wheat from the chaff..."

I had all these crates full of vinyl records I had bought from the mid-70s until I finally bought a CD player in the early '90s that were just gathering dust. My old turntable had issues and wasn't easily repairable. And my receiver had a bad channel. So I went the retro route, first locally-sourcing stuff, later going the ebay route. I ended up with several turntables, several old 1970s Pioneer receivers, a few cassette decks, new old speakers, totally retro. That lasted not quite a year before I lost interest. Yes, it sounds good, but I seem to have lost that desire for the one true sound that I once had. Now it is all gathering dust again."
1319,"December 11, 2014 10:03AM",graphicguy,"FN....it's a long story. Reader's Digest version, I got a deal I couldn't pass up. Had a couple of hiccups, but they seem to be sorting themselves out. Cadillac is really stepping it up. CTS has turned into something I never would have expected. They're shooting at E class, 5 Series, and A6, and bulls eyeing the targets, in some ways, exceeding what the others are doing.

Test drove the ATS a couple of times. That car's a blast, too. You'd like it.

Leather....I've heard the argument that Mercedes ""pleather"" is better than leather. That mostly came from their dealers. However their fake stuff may or may not wear well, I'm sure it's cheaper for them than putting leather in their cars.

Even old leather looks great. Not sure that old vinyl will look all that good down the road. I know old vinyl never smells good. To me, it's a cost cutting move by Mercedes. I can't imagine paying $50K? $60K? Maybe more, and not getting leather as part of the package.

If I were going to see any potential problem with the new TLX, it would have been with their transmissions. Acura/Honda has had a bit of a history with dicey transmissions. I really like the TLX. I hope they get that shift button thing sorted out in short fashion, and it will only take once. They are kind of on a sales roll with their vehicles right now. It would be a shame that this would bring them to a halt. If they've stopped selling the TLX, it looks like that's exactly what happened, though. I can't imagine how long it will take for then to identify the cause, come up with a fix, and get all those cars in the shops to make the fix. Hope it works out well for them.

Thanks for the professional opinion RB. I'm waiting to hear that defense in a DUI case sooner rather than later."
1320,"December 11, 2014 1:36PM",dino001,"I'm with Graphic on leather. I drove several loaners with the ""ette"" and they did not feel that great. Rough touch, dull color and of course smell. All the ""tex"", ""ette"" stuff is to me selling a simple fake for a price of real stuff (50 grand or more) and great legend so they can cash the profit - and charging extra if you insist on real stuff. Well, they obviously can get away with that. Especially Benz. I see BMWs have much higher percentage of real leather, but new 320 may buck the trend.

If not leather, I would rather choose premium microfiber seats (if they made), just like for a couch, as those at least would be better in hot-and-cold sweat absorption, be nicer in touch and even stronger than leather. And it doesn't pretend to be something else."

1345,"December 17, 2014 12:51PM",ivan_99,"I don't think I'd do a CPO again.

I had an 06 IS350. When I purchased it it was 2 years old...but quickly turned 3 a few months later.

Even though I had the CPO warranty I had a few items that fell outside of that coverage (which was annoying).

The biggest problem I had was after year 3 of the payments I was (still) making payments for a 5-6 year old car. So when you're nearing 5 years of payments you're paying for an 8-9 year old car. I knew all this going in...but didn't think I'd have an issue making payments on an ""old"" car. It held up fairly well, but there were still wear and tear issues that revealed themselves when it was 6 years old (tiny chunks of the dash crumbling off, suspension creaks, few rattles, etc.).

To make matters worse, you're paying a premium for the CPO; mine was at least $2k over a comparable model (and mileage). So if you're attempting to sell early you're at a disadvantage.

Plus...when I traded it in (at another dealer) it was revealed that at some point before I purchased it there was a claim for hail damage; so this reduced it's trade in value. My fault here...I assumed CPO vehicles never had been in accidents/claims, etc; doesn't cost much to do a quick search...

1350,"December 17, 2014 8:00PM",sweendogy,The payments someone would make on a cpo would be a lot less then a new car. Yes the car would be older but the payments would significantly less and the ability to buy a better car (all in) with less cash. The financing rates of used are as good as new - so that's not the issue- if you are paying for a cpo 5 years after delivery you should not be buying a Cpo- you should not be buying a new car- you should lease or maybe downgrade expectations on what you can afford.
1351,"December 17, 2014 8:30PM",stickguy,"I agree with Sween. And NYC. NYC in that I don't want to pay on a car more than 4-5 YO. And sween that if you are, you spent too much on the CPO.

I look at a CPO this way. If I am willing to go 5 years payments on a new car, I will go 3 on a 2 YO CPO. Payments end at the same age. So the only way it makes sense is if the price is lower enough to make it worthwhile, since I am giving up two years use on the car (and the best 2!)

Plus you have to keep a car older than 5 years, otherwise you are always making payments. Though overall the payments should be lower (since the car is cheaper) but that can actually cancel out if you trade every 3 years."

1367,"December 19, 2014 10:08AM",graphicguy,"I've tried to like Infinitis for a long time. Every time I look at them and test drive them, I'm disappointed.

Assuming the Q70 used to be the former M chassis. What's the point of going from one letter to another?

I know they did make a drastic price cut of the former G series, and that may be saving their bacon. But, even there, it's long in the tooth and certainly not very fuel efficient, by any stretch.

I just don't know where they are competing."

1369,"December 19, 2014 2:10PM",markcincinnati,"Well, here are some thoughts on Infiniti -- from a former owner of an Infiniti product and also, at the same time, an Acura product.

The auto manufacturers in the past decades have wanted to ""rationalize"" their product names. They have wanted to do so for essentially a singular purpose: marketing (leading to increased market share, mind share, sales, etc.)

Infiniti decided that Q was the answer as a prefix and that the following numbers/letter combination would signify the size or perhaps even class of the vehicle. I would assume if money were no object they would have liked to have rolled out a completely new -- across the board -- product family. They had to settle for one new car, the Q50. The M37 became the Q70 as you identified.

It is true that most of us here on Edmunds know the Q70 is the former M37. I would posit that most people, however, won't have a clue that the Q70 is a renamed product.

The M37 and the Q70 are still very competent LPS offerings, even though the Q70 does need to be updated, refreshed or replaced with a newer version. To me, Infinitis have often been [note the tense] the most German-like of the Japanese (and Korean) offerings. The recent ""transfer"" of their President, Johan De Nysschen, (then late of Audi) to go to Cadillac probably is a negative for Infiniti -- but, well, there you have it -- since I would have assumed Johan would have made good use of his 19-year Audi stint to imbue Infiniti with even more German-ness.

Right now, it seems to me that Infiniti and Acura, both, appear to be somewhat rudderless if their recent products are any indication of what is going on ""at the top."" The TLX could've have been the vehicle for Acura to announce ""we're not Honda anymore,"" but I think they missed the target completely if you axed me.

Meantime, Lexus has inched its way even further from Toyota and the Koreans are the ones the Germans are probably seeing in their rear-view mirrors more so than anything out of Japan (with the possible exception of the IS350F-sport).

Again, if you axed me, the saving grace for the Germans is the brand name ""KIA"" -- at least if you live here in River City where removing all the KIA badges seems the norm. If KIA somehow figures out a new name (think GoldStar becoming LG) for their brand, I would think the Germans might have more to worry about.

Today, the Germans seem to be the aspirational cars -- but, as the poet Frost once said, ""nothing gold can stay."" I did enjoy my time with my 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance, but -- money not a factor -- my 2014 S4 is an entirely different experience (despite my belief that the TL was about as close to an S4 as one could get for about $47K.)

If you can get a Cpo that fits your criteria why would you not want to save first year depresh- even if it's not cpo you can still get a better (than cpo) deal with the balance of a luxury car makers warrantee and get a better car then you would if new.

The new Genesis is a more substantial car, and the weight has a predictable effect at the track. Acceleration from 0 to 60 mph comes in 5.2 seconds, up from that last-gen Genesis' 4.8-second time. That makes the 2015 Genesis V-8 a midpack performer, depending on what you think its competitors are. Smaller, pricier V-8-powered competitors such as the Mercedes-Benz E550 and Infiniti Q70 5.6 will smoke the Genesis V-8. Among price-competitive offerings, an all-wheel-drive 2012 Audi A6 with a supercharged V-6 engine sprinted from 0-60 mph in 4.7 seconds, while a 2012 BMW 535i checked in at 5.5 seconds, an all-wheel-drive 2014 Mercedes-Benz E350 at 5.8 seconds, and a 2013 Lexus GS 350 F Sport with a six-speed automatic at 5.4 seconds. Passing power from 45-65 mph is ample in the Genesis V-8, with a 2.6-second time not appreciably different from that of the last-gen Genesis V-8 (2.4 seconds), A6 3.0T (2.5 seconds), and 2013 GS 350 F Sport (2.6 seconds), but quicker than the 535i's 2.9 seconds and the 2014 CTS 3.6's 3.1 seconds."

I have the 2013 R-spec sedan. I'm very impressed with ride, quality of this vehicle. Nothing but high praise. Handling is not in the Audi or BMW category but that's not why I bought this vehicle. The Genesis is very big inside , ultra quiet on the road , One of the best sounding radio systems ( lexicon ) 17 speakers in any car I heard. Plenty of giddy up when you want to live life fast @429 h/p A good bang for your buck. CR reports / C&D and most reviewers have put the new 2015 model at the top of the pack . A real good buy for your money if you could get past the brand.

I test drove the 2015 Genesis v-6.. This luxury sedan @48k is a great choice that offers amenities that European vehicles are selling 15, to 20k more. The Upgraded suspension modes , Handling, Refinement is well noted on this 2015 model . Add Hyundai's 5/60....100k powertrain warranty makes this vehicle quite appealing .

When I driving between Phoenix and San Diego the beginning of the year (weekly) I racked up a lot of miles, but the service indicator in the car kept the same date for when the car will need service, but in June I brought the car into the dealer to get the oil changed since I had 13K miles on the car, cost, $110...

1414,"December 26, 2014 11:07PM",markcincinnati,"~
BMW has not done much, if anything, because it ""needs"" to make money. It is a for profit company it does everything it does because it must make money -- fine point between needs and must, I know, but I think it is a given that all of these automobile companies are for profit. They were when they made the versions of cars that ""used to be"" so much better -- if they actually were better then than they are now.

The perspective that I hold currently is that BMW is actually making cars they have evidence their customers want. They have ""proof"" that their new cars are an improvement over their previous models and their customers affirm that proof. If the customers don't affirm, they make changes to the cars until the cars ""succeed.""

A key reason for the almost total abandonment of the manual transmission, for example, (by BMW, to name just one) is the customers (BMW is seeking) perceive them to be less desirable than the automatic shifting transmissions available.

Said another way, automatic transmissions are superior to manual transmissions -- according to the market BMW caters to and wants (and needs and must) to sell to. That is an empirical fact -- it is not an opinion (based on the results that can be measured). If you -- the rhetorical you -- believe a manual transmission is superior, that is your opinion. The facts do not support the opinion, or if so, only slightly. Now one may prefer a manual transmission (again this is but one example) over a manual transmission, but that -- from the perspective that BMW values -- is an outlier, an anomaly, virtually irrelevant.

I believe I have suggested previously, that ""we"" killed manual transmissions -- we killed them by not buying them, not because they weren't or aren't offered; they're not offered because we didn't buy them.

Likewise, 4 and 6 cylinder engines (as another example) replaced 8 cylinder engines because ""we"" deemed them superior -- and proved thus by buying cars with 6's and 4's. The market proved that there really was a substitute for displacement -- and that was volume-metric efficiency.

I do not believe that ALL new BMW's or Mercedes or Audis or whatever brand you favor are superior to their ""ancestors"", but the vast majority, the overwhelming majority of them are.

I applaud anyone's affection for nostalgia -- I am often sentimental; the older I get the more I represent that remark, in fact. But nostalgia often -- some would say always -- represents a filtered view of the past. BMW (et al) would almost certainly fail if it attempted to build its new cars to emulate its previous generations, no matter how highly acclaimed or ""remembered"" they may be.

Auto transmissions, forced induction smaller displacement engines, softer riding suspensions and more and more reliance upon ""technology"" are good things, superior things, actual improvements over previous generation's offerings and capabilities.

You may not, for whatever reason, agree -- but the market, fundamentally, says you're wrong.

Now, being somewhat (sometimes) of a fellow Luddite, I did (and sometimes still do) mourn the virtual and soon to be total death of the manual transmission. However, now that I have 20,000 miles worth of experience with an Audi 7-speed DSG connected to a super-charged 6, I must finally admit Eli Whitney had a pretty good idea after all.

Dammit!"
1415,"December 27, 2014 8:35AM",roadburner,"I don't think the enthusiasts are actually clamoring for simply a remanufactured 2002; what they want is a car that continues to embody the traditional BMW virtues- a nimble car that communicates what it is doing to the driver. Cadillac and Lexus are actually moving into that automotive niche while BMW abandons it. Pandering to the status-conscious ""wearers"" who want a featherbed ride and minimum involvement in the driving process may generate short-term gains, but those folks will move on to the next shiny ""in"" bauble in a heartbeat."
1416,"December 27, 2014 9:04AM",cdnpinhead,"The emphasis on electronic gadgetry and increasingly complex solutions to fairly simple problems (8-speed automatic transmission, anyone) is what leads so many people to dread running these ""new and improved"" cars bare (past their warranties).

I fail to see why EPA/CARB-driven cars are superior to the incredible variety of vehicles that are available in Europe and elsewhere in the world. Certifying a drive train is so bloody expensive in the U.S. that any given manufacturer limits what's sold here to a bare minimum. If BMW sold any of the small diesel wagons (with a manual) that have been available for decades elsewhere here in the U.S. I'd already be driving one.

Oh, and if anyone thinks run-flat tires, another solution looking for a problem, make any sense out here in the West, I'd be interested in their reasoning. Driving hundreds of miles with only rudimentary services available, particularly on the weekends and/or at night, without a spare tire of any kind, is asking for a three-day delay while the necessary $300 tire is shipped to within 50 miles of where you had a simple flat tire. Then there's the question of whether the tire machine at Ed's Gas, Bait and Whorehouse in Austin, NV, will be able to get it installed without totally wrecking the new tire, the wheel, or both.

It's clear that the majority, as dictated to by various governments, have given us the selection of vehicles that are available. I choose not to participate, and I don't think I'm alone. The majority on here seem to think it's wonderful. Party on."
1417,"December 27, 2014 9:18AM",cdnpinhead,I'm not.
1418,"December 27, 2014 9:57AM",markcincinnati,"The cars that are sold here in the US at least are here because of the customers, not the government. The governmental rules and regulations do not single out BMW or Cadillac or Fiat. The playing field, so to speak, is level. How a company responds to these regulations is what differentiates it.

Overwhelmingly, the reason the cars from BMW are they way they are is because these cars sell -- if manual transmission diesel Bimmers, etc, were selling, they'd be brought into the US (assuming they are actually manufactured).

In the universe that I am familiar with, I know that Audi of America responded to a LOUD, but very very tiny campaign (that I participated in) to reintroduce the manual transmission to the A6. Audi went ahead and made the A6 manual trans version available to US customers. The cars sat on the lots of understandably pissed dealers who bought the cars for inventory only to have them sit and sit and sit for months and months.

I did go ahead and order the ""last"" manual transmission (think of the song the ""Last DJ"") Audi of size in 2003. It was an allroad and I had to special order it because the dealership general manager told me he had been burned by millions tied up in floorplanning manual trans A6's to an unmoved and ""I'll take my business elsewhere"" market.

The last BMW I drove was a 2014 5 series with a bunch of options including X-drive and all of the stuff BMW deems fit to call ""sport"" or at least sport-like. The car was quick, fast, quiet, comfortable and for its size cornered like a snake in a rat hole (credit my wife for the phrase).

One of the folks I work with has a 2005 BMW 5 series -- there is no comparison, the 2014 is the more desirable car.

The car is what it is due to the votes cast by the market. We may, or some of us may, deride the newer cars as mere shadows of their ancestors, posers even; but, again, from the perspective of the engineers, marketers, sales people, etc associated with BMW, the new cars are improvements, advancements of the ""breed"" (or brand, at least).

Yeah, I know, I'm preaching to the:

Use it
Use it up
Wear it out
Do without. . .

crowd.

But, whatever one likes is certainly one's prerogative. I'll defend that too."
1419,"December 27, 2014 10:33AM",cdnpinhead,"BMW UK lists 46 variants of the 3-series with gasoline engines and a further 61 in diesel. They don't all represent different drivelines, but at least half do, with different engine size, transmission and AWD options that would each have to be certified separately by the EPA at what I'm told is huge expense. This in a country that is right-hand drive, while the majority of BMW production goes the other way, so don't tell me about economy of scale.

I wouldn't mind ordering the car just the way I wanted it, if I could, but only a handful of the variants are available over here, and none are the ones I'm interested in. I think they've finally got oil level indicators that work, unlike the those that were first introduced to replace the stone-simple dipstick . Apparently one of the reasons was the oil vapor that escaped from the open dipstick tube(?!). Well beyond the point of diminishing returns I would think.

I could change out the solid-rubber-feeling run-flats but there's no point with the vehicle choice that's available here."
1420,"December 27, 2014 1:55PM",markcincinnati,"Wow! That's variety. My question is this: would there be a market for 107 variants of the 3-series in the US? And, that question assumes the cost of marketing to ""the market"" would have to include certification for the US. My assumption is that the market for 107 variants of the 3-series just isn't there, for if it were, it would seem to make sense that BMW (of America) would go ahead and import (and bear the cost of certification) the ""in demand"" portion of the range up to 107 variants. Someone, in charge, must have the data to support not doing this -- and by data I mean sales data or market research in support of increased choice.

Of course I said my assumption -- is there any reason to think there IS a [profitable] market for that kind of variety?

While I am at asking [hypothetical] questions, I am wondering why I've never seen an Audi or BMW (or any other brand, perhaps excluding Porsche) with a red leather interior ""in inventory""? -- yet it seems that ""everyone"" says they love red leather interiors. Both my wife and I had to order red leather in our 2014 Audi S cars -- despite the dealer telling us that if they do a dealer trade and end up with a car with red leather that such an outfitted car typically sells more quickly than one with, say, black or gray or brown leather.

I assume the dealer rep was probably patronizing us [regarding red leather] (at least a little bit) but the claim is that white is the single most popular car color and dealer inventories (of Audis and BMWs) do seem to support that notion.

One more question: what does it mean to say something to the effect that such and such a brand of car is ""worn"" (as opposed to driven, I assume)? I read the comment that new BMWs appeal to customers who want to wear their cars -- suggesting to me that the characterization ""worn"" was pejorative (at least as far as the author was concerned)."
1421,"December 27, 2014 2:16PM",roadburner,"As I noted in another topic, in 2007 I wrote an article on the international launch of the E93. I noted that BMW would sell every one they make, even if it had the driving dynamics of a Chevrolet Cobalt. The latest BMWs aren't nearly that bad-yet-but perhaps the tagline ""The Ultimate Fashion Accessory"" would be a more accurate advertising theme."
1422,"December 28, 2014 8:10PM",stickguy,"I actually thought that the 320i, when it was introduced, was what purists were looking for. Simpler, marginally lighter, cheaper. More of the spiritual descendant to the early 2002 and 3 series cars than a massively powered 335. The volume model in the later 90s/early 2000s was likely the 323/325, right?

so if anything, the 320 really is the entry level BMW to allow people that want one to get into ""the family"", same as the 323/325 did previously. it drives like a BMW, looks and feels like one, etc. So if anything, the purist's problem shouldn't be with the 320, it is the whole series."
1423,"December 28, 2014 8:14PM",roadburner,"I'd consider a 320i if the steering was decent- I just can't accept a setup that is so devoid of feel- in a BMW, at any rate."
1424,"December 30, 2014 9:29AM",graphicguy,"Sorry FN....just saw your question. Spent last week visiting wife's brother in San Francisco.

I got the CTS AWD Performance version. The Magnetic Ride suspension is the real deal. Allegedly, the MRC is capable of infinitely changing the shock settings something like a 1,000 times a second, depending on road conditions. It has its own version of torque vectoring. These ""trick"" torque vectoring schemes really do improve the handling of these cars (as with the Audi S and TL SH AWD).

It smooths out the roughest roads, yet stays sharp when cornering and rotating. Like most cars in this class, the adjustable suspension is available. I keep it in ""Sport"", which firms the steering response (best version of electronic steering I've used) and changes shift patterns. Feels much like a RWD based Audi Quattro or TL SH AWD.

Put it in ""touring"" mode, and it feels much like a 4matic E class or an A6 Quattro.

Sport mode, while ""firm"" really doesn't describe the ride accurately,

Great seats, while not the sport seats in the TL SH AWD (which I loved), but certainly more ""sporty"" and comfortable than the hard, flat Mercedes seats. and not nearly as ""hard"" as the S4's.

Not as speedy as an Audi S4, but quite torquey. Probably 0-60 in the 5 1/2 to 6 second range.....works for me. Probably more torque in the lower rev ranges than the TL....especially around town. It gets up and scoots to extra legal speeds in short order on the highway.

All the gee gaws. It took a few days to get used to CUE. But, now that I am, all the controls for it fall immediately to had once the proximity sensor senses your hand near the screen. Touch controls work. Instead of sliding the ""metal bars"", you realize those bars are only there to guide your fingers. You slide just above the metal bars.

All the chrome, wood, aluminum, suede, leather, etc is all real. Build and materials are all exemplary and as good, or better than anything in the class.

For reasons that befuddle me (and probably Cadillac, considering the accolades the car has received), the discounts were substantial on the CTS. I got into one for about the price of a middle of the road A4, TL, 3 series.....a screaming bargain, that according to their management, will be the last time those deals will be available for the same car.

Yes, it's new. Yes, I'm enamored with it. Pretty darn happy with a car that's made in Detroit that's able to match, and in some important ways, excel over the E, A6, etc out there."
1425,"December 30, 2014 10:23AM",billyperks4,Graph- Can I ask? Why did you get rid of your TL?
1426,"December 30, 2014 10:26AM",graphicguy,"RB...you're a track guy. I admire you as your interest in track work isn't just superficial (vs some people I know who trick out their autox cars and like their car's decals more than their cars).

I did some autox years ago (in a Toyota Corolla 16V), but I was mostly a 1/4 mile, dragstrip guy....had my own rat rod for that very purpose.

Some people (including myself) just want a good handling car that can get out of its own way and offers some creature comforts.

The majority want a 3 pointed star, or a roundel. Their car hunt begins and ends there.

stick....I view the 320i to be a spiritual successor to the 2002. Having been in one of the original 2002s (not mine, but a college friend's), they broke the mold. BMW has built on that success. They are where they are today as a result of the 2002's initial success."

1429,"December 30, 2014 4:04PM",graphicguy,"Billy...I really had no good reason to explain why I got rid of the TL SH AWD. Great cars....all the TL's I've had.

Long and short of it, through a friend of a friend, I met the owner (and his son) of a Caddy dealer that my late Mother did business with. I had relayed the terrible experience my late Mother had with the dealership about 10 years ago (one that I had to get involved with to work it out). He explained that the entire staff had turned over since then, and that he was not aware of my Mother's issues. He invited me to just come in and meet his son, who had just been named the GM of the dealership and to see how they had totally refurbished the physical building.

I'm a car guy. I was curious. Went there. Got a tour of the newly remodelled dealership. Was invited to take a car home over the weekend. Really was enamored with the way the CTS drove and how well it was built. I essentially got a $60K car less $15K+ and, over two years of ownership, I only lost $6K on the TL. Thought it was a good deal.

Rest is history."
1430,"December 30, 2014 7:04PM",sweendogy,@graphicguy - can you go over those numbers again with this trade - / hard to believe you got 15k off a new car and then at the same time were able to trade the TL in for 6k less then paid after 2 years- (did you also get 6k off when buying the TL originally? I have done a few car deals in my day but this tops the cake.
1431,"December 30, 2014 7:32PM",graphicguy,"Sween...paid $38 and change for the TL. Caddy dealer gave $32. Figure he'll ask 34, sell for 33.

CTS is a '14....C&D Top 10. Caddy can't sell them. Don't know why. It's as nice of a car as I've ever driven. Caddy slapped a $6K rebate on them. I figure there's another $5K in hidden trunk money. Dealer sells at cost, moves a unit, gets closer to 2014 GM unit bonus."
1432,"December 31, 2014 4:29AM",circlew,"And to be fair, the new CTS is priced right in line with the cars that GM sees as its key competitors: the Mercedes-Benz E Class, the BMW 5-Series, and Audi's A6.

But Cadillac's customers aren't used to paying those kinds of prices, and some are shopping elsewhere. Meanwhile, BMW and Mercedes buyers aren't (yet) flocking to Cadillac's showrooms to make up the difference.

In other words, Cadillac is losing its old customers -- but isn't yet winning enough new ones to make up the difference. So, why isn't Cadillac trimming its prices?

Not long ago, a price cut would have been GM's response. But these days, Cadillac is under new management -- and its new president, longtime Audi executive Johan de Nysschen, ordered something different: a big cut in production at the factory that makes the two sedans."
1433,"December 31, 2014 9:15AM",graphicguy,"circle....good points. I think Cadillac is going through a transition. Not sure if people are used to paying prices similar to Benz or Audi or BMW. My dealer says he sells every $85K Escalade he can get his hands on....at MSRP plus. Cadillac split their lux sport sedan series in two. What used to be the CTS doing battle against the 3 and 5 series, the C and E class, the Audi A4 and A6, is now the duty of the ATS against the 3, C and A4, with the CTS doing battle against the 5, E, and A6.

CTS moved up the ladder, with the ATS going against the cars we talk about in here.

Their President even admitted this isn't going to happen over night, but will probably take a couple of years.

Cadillac is in a unique situation where they don't seem to care about their ""traditional"" customer. I don't know if they ever would have snagged me unless the CTS were such a very good car to begin with.

You'll have the customer who bought a previous gen of the CTS and walk into the showroom thinking ""no way I'll spend $7K more for the new one over the old one."" Cadillac points them in the direction of the ATS and says....here's a better car than your previous CTS and it costs less. Some will get that. Some won't.

However, if you want an even better car than the ATS, here's the CTS.

Again, it will take some time. And, some won't even like the way the new ATS or CTS drive, given they are more on the sports end of the luxury sports sedan/coupe market.

But, once they take hold, I think they have a very good foundation to build on to compete, and excel in both spaces.

They seem determined to do what it takes to get there. Good cars. Drive an ATS or CTS if you get a chance. They are very good sport luxury cars....almost getting to the point where tehy are filling the voids that Mercedes and BMW have abandoned."

I'm one of the few who actually liked the TL's styling. But, I realize I was in the minority. Good cars, especially for the money.

CTS is a different level of car. The CTS' turbo 2.0L performs better than the TL with the 3.7L 6 cylinder. 50-50 weight distribution which makes for great CTS handling.

In short, it looks better, handles better, performs better, is build better with better materials than my TL. That said, the CTS costs thousands more, too. So, it better be that much better than the TL.

In the honeymoon phase with it. If it stays out of the dealership service dept, I'll be a happy camper."

Oh, I need to correct that: the Audi Connect feature (free for 6 months) was great (when it worked) when I was ""in signal."" The thing is, someone at Audi of America made a deal with ""the fastest"" 3G provider (at the time) T-Mobile. However, at least in SW Ohio the coverage, at best, is poor-to-fair, and overall is 2G to poor. The screen indicator registers 2G about 1/3rd of the time (which renders the feature useless). Now, it is true that when T-Mobile is able to pump out true 3G it can be as good as what sometimes passes for 4G from some carriers.

I had enjoyed using this feature with the voice command to verbally invoke ""Internet Destination, Morton's of Chicago"" or other destinations that would have normally had to have been found via calling 411, getting the number, calling the ""destination"" asking for the address and THEN entering it into the sat nav.

The thing is, the price for this service is $30/month -- which is galling since the TV commercials claim (for SW Ohio) 4, 4G LTE lines (family promo) for $100/mo.

Of course, were I to buy a new A3, Audi Connect no longer uses T-Mobile.

I'd pay $10/month for this crappy (T-Mobile) service -- but $30 for 2G? No way.

The concept and the technology (in the car) make a lot of sense and when things work as expected (even in 3G) the execution is great (within a two block radius of a certain signal location). Swapping out the radio or ""unlocking"" the radio via software or some other method (the sim card?) would make my experience with this vehicle ""the best ever.""

For those folks who want driving performance, I can assure you the S4 (with the 7-speed DSG) is, let me see, effortless to drive, meaning that there is nothing (within reason) the car won't do without breaking a sweat. Another descriptive term: ""carve"" -- driving the car is as effortless as cutting warm butter with a hot knife.

Obviously, I am off-put by one little piece of tech that some folks who live in a strong T-Mobile reception areas probably can't relate to. But in terms of reliability and ""tightness"" this S4 is as new-feeling at 22K miles as it was with 22 miles.

That's the story so far."

The dealer was very laid back no pushing us to sit down and talk numbers. As we were talking to the salesman, a lot person brought up a new 2015 RC in Molton Pearl (orange) wow is all I have to say, what a stunning color.. It was a FC-F Sport, $51K it had the Mark Levinson/Nav package, we talked about it and I test drove it, I came very close in getting it, WOW, what a car, but the salesman was honest and told me that dealer isn't dealing on them and I would pay MSRP for it..

I drove the ATS 2.0T and 3.6. The high sticker shock was tremendous and a first strike. A minor imperfection in the roadway unsettling the car and suspension was strike 2, and I just didn't feel the in the pants OOMPH from the butt Dyno I wanted to feel. I may have to start driving used broken-in cars with some miles on them already because I think programming is making some of these new cars feel sluggish on test drives due to perhaps ""built-in"" breaking-in programming?"
1468,"January 16, 2015 2:19PM",andres3,"When did GM end the across the board 5 yr./100K miles Power Train Warranty? That was better, though only marginally than the 6 yr./70. I remember they even extended that old 100K warranty to SAAB.

I wasn't frightened at one point of the reliability of my mid-90's Dodge either. I figured by the mid-nineties Americans had figured out how to make a halfway decently reliable car. Didn't stop it from being a lemon though."
1469,"January 16, 2015 3:24PM",markcincinnati,"Reliable and Durable:

I am not a good ambassador of/for the durability of [Audi's in particular] German cars -- since the highest mileage I've ever put on one was just south of 67,000 miles (a 2005 Audi A6 3.2). However, my Audis (and we've had dozens of them) have always been very reliable (excluding our 1978 Audi 5000 which did die young, or at least the battery died young). We never had what I would call a catastrophic failure of the drive train in any of them, period.

Moreover, I suspect our 2011 Infiniti FX35 would have ""run perfectly"" until the wheels turned square and the pistons fell apart -- but we only kept it until it had some 55,000 miles on the OD, so again, who knows -- it, like our Audis was totally reliable. And then:Our 2012 Acura SH-AWD seemed like a budget Audi S4 (a good thing), but it certainly felt both flimsy and tinny (even the doors closed with wimpy thud). And the brakes had about one good stop in them from speed before they faded; and, the rotors almost always felt warped -- even though much of that turned out to be three bent wheels (that Acura paid 50% of the cost of replacement). Three bent wheels? Even if I was abusive while driving, I still find it hard to believe there were 3 bent wheels -- and that the original dealer never thought to road-force balance the wheels to see if THAT was the reason the brakes always appeared to chatter and rumble so.

I have to assume the new ATS and CTS (I did drive the latter) are very fine cars -- my in-laws were Cadillac people, but their experiences were with much older models (pre-2007) and during those [dark] years, their Cadillacs could hardly drive past the dealership without needing to go in to remedy some malady or another.

Cars of all ilks, today, I must assume are very reliable and probably durable, too. I am thinking that based on the way my wife puts miles on her SQ5, we may want to trade it in after about 36-42 months due to the ""depreciation"" hit that happens at about 100,000 miles, not due to any serious ""durability"" or reliability issues.

I can't remember where I read (or heard, perhaps) that virtually all ""modern"" cars will be essentially trouble free (not necessarily low maintenance, though) for a minimum of 150,000 miles. One of the folks I work with has a Bimmer (530) with over 170,000 miles on it and has never had any major repairs, only the maintenance required by the book. He's had dents and dings aplenty (and had them all fixed), but nothing major, ever.

My friend says he puts about $500 in the car two or three times per year -- and everything works pretty much the same as it did when he bought the thing new in 2004.

I'm a fan of the ""factory"" sponsored extended mntce and warranty programs -- and in my case, since my car is leased, I can have the car CPO'd to 100,000 miles for about $1,500 as long as I do so under 50,000 miles and have proof I've maintained the scheduled mntce requirements.

I keep thinking this S4 is so good it will be a keeper -- at least so long as at least one of our cars has the latest and greatest technology. That's the drawback -- as each new gen of these cars comes out they add or update some ""gotta have"" feature or tech (yeah, ""gotta have"" for me, that is). My friend who is part owner of an airplane says he just keeps upgrading his decades old plane with the newest and greatest tech and rebuilds the engine so that despite its age, his plane is actually kept completely up to date. Makes me wish at least some of that approach would trickle down to automobiles.

First thing I'd do is swap out that T-Mobile Internet connection module/radio. Why can't there just be a jack that allows the car to ""sniff"" the Internet from my iPhone. I know, follow the money.

In conclusion, congratulations and kudos to those of you getting new Cadillacs and frankly just about anything new that might qualify today as an ELLPS or LPS car. I wonder, too, at the price point, if the new Genesis is yet a candidate for either ""class"" [of car] -- I've looked at them and they are seriously -- almost Audi A6 -- nice. Yet they're priced like an A4.

Happy New Year."

Still looking for something RWD under $40k that shows even the slightest promise of being entertaining.
No joy."
1471,"January 17, 2015 9:05AM",graphicguy,"Mark....well said. I think all manufacturers, but particularly the American marques, have made such great strides in build, reliability, and longevity that is unparrallelled in any time in the industy's history.

It used to be Honda or Toyota were the brands you bought for reliability. Not so sure you can make a significant case for that any more. Aside from Land Rover and Smart, who iare notoriously troublesome, one should expect a long, durable life from all of today's cars.

Technology in cars is moving at break neck speed. You mentioned having your car become a wifi hot spot. Who would have thought of that even 5 short years ago?

In these classes of cars, in addition to great motors and transmissions, suspensions become much more sophosticated. I know in the CTS, I'm amazed at how smooth the suspension is on the interstate, and at the same time can carve up some backroads with equal sophistication.

With the torque vectoring you find in your S4, and what I had in my TL SH AWD, Cadillac has their own version of it, allowing rotation and curve hugging that borders on the unbelievable.

Even the materials in cars of this class are first rate. While both my Audi and TL had pleasant materials, Cadillac is using real wood, real aluminum, real chrome, real suede, controls work like they are bathed in butter or have a tactile feel that really begins to define what the marketers are striving for.....a high end, high quality look ad feel.

Aside from some of the foibles we have had with our cars (mostly along the lines of dealers and/or manufacturers not listening to our complaints), our cars are at the height of car making right now....again, especially in this class."
1472,"January 17, 2015 9:12AM",stickguy,"on the flip side GG, the thought of keeping these modern hi-tech marvels for a long time/lot of miles is scary. My 2000 TL went 175K for me, but that car was a relative ox-cart compared to yours. The only worry I had was the tranny crapping out, and that was still simple even if it would cost around 3K! The rest of the fancy stuff was basic (bun warmers, BOSE radio, normal power options). I changed out the suspension front and rear on sale at Sears for about $600."
1473,"January 17, 2015 12:09PM",qbrozen,"Huh. But you were looking at Challengers, right? I'm surprised considering the cars you seem to love are pretty lightweight. You checked out the Toyobaru, right? I would imagine the power is a letdown, though. What else have you tried out? New Stang, perhaps?"
1474,"January 17, 2015 12:25PM",graphicguy,"Stick...all good points. I don't think I worry as much about things going awry because it's rare that I keep a car outside the warranty term. I can't imagine what the cost would be to replace something like iDrive, MMI, CUE, etc. Then again, so much of it is software based, maybe they just download firmware.

As it stands, I can control my iPhone through CUE (Siri eyes) now. Is it a big jump to think that the electronics on our cars will be controlled entirely by our smart devices? I have the Magnetic Ride Control on the CTS. Is it far fetched to theink that Cadillac can change the algorithm to how it respoinds via a software download via your phone? How about changing how your steering responds via download, given that most are electronic steering systems today?

Cadillac could change the entier look of CUE and the way it fhnctions with a download. But, you have to have that starting point in order to do that.

Will that make cars more or less reliable as a result? These are all hypotheticals, but it doesn't take too big of a leap of faith to see where this could go."
1475,"January 17, 2015 1:39PM",roadburner,"I still like the Challenger R/T and SRT,; big as they are they are pretty quick(well, the SRT is, at least) and just entertaining and involving in a way that most of the other cars I've looked at just aren't.
I want to like the BRZ/FR-S but I just can't. Not appreciably quicker than my Club Sport with no other redeeming qualities.
The Mustang? I looked at an Ecoboost, but really, a ponycar without a V8 is like the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue without Kathy Ireland(that dates me, I realize). As for the V8, yes, it's fast and handles well, but again, it lacks that ""Gotta Have It!"" vibe I need to keep a sled long term.
The Challenger is big and brash and unashamedly retro in an intriguing way- and with the SRT notching up a 1/4 mile time in the high 12 second range along with decent handling and braking, I could enjoy it for some time. If I'm going to have numb steering I want some other facets of the car to entertain me- and the F30 3ers just don't excite me at all- even my lowly MS3 can show a clean pair of heels to a 335i these days..."

1478,"January 18, 2015 5:42PM",roadburner,You will soon be able to get a tune from Ford Racing that provides a healthy power bump yet preserves the factory warranty. The FRPP tune for the Focus ST boosts midrange torque by 90 lb-ft.

1481,"January 19, 2015 9:17PM",roadburner,My mildly tuned MS3 develops an average of 50 lb-ft of torque over the stock engine from 3000 rpm to 6000 rpm and fuel economy actually improved a bit- when I can resist the urge to stay out of boost...
1482,"January 20, 2015 7:49AM",qbrozen,"So, yes, if you drive the vehicle to its potential (where you are actually utilizing that extra power), you will burn more fuel. So that is one reason. As for the warranty, well, stressing an engine just a little more and lasting through the warranty period isn't so tough. It is the longevity after the warranty expires that engineers can still concern themselves with. A particular car brand wouldn't sell too well if the majority of them self-destruct at 80k miles, for example. So sell the car with an less-stressed engine and that 99% of buyers who never modify it will demonstrate the car's reliability and reinforce a reputation. (that is, of course, for cars with a good reputation)"
1483,"January 20, 2015 3:08PM",flightnurse,"My tune on my BMW has not affected my MPG at all, I'm still averaging 30."
1484,"January 21, 2015 7:21AM",markcincinnati,"Getting a state of tune that increases torque and power and comes as a factory option is:

1. An additional revenue stream
2. Not standard since it probably impacts the durability of the car in question -- but, due to the probable customer who would pay the additional and want the power bump, probably not that much of an issue since the customer MAY be inclined to not keep the car into triple digit (before the 000) miles.

This factory option, then is probably a win for all, in short.

I look at what APR and others have done for the current S4 and even RS7 Audis -- and I'm tempted. But, then, I also know the risk of running naked, without a warranty -- and I think, nah baby nah.

I at least like the concept and notion that my S4 will be both reliable (not too much of a stretch for any car, these days) AND durable (that's the $64,000 or in my case $57,000 question.) The standard state of tune, I'd wager is more likely to have that characteristic. Further, when I push the S4 in standard tune, it seems to me to be so much more capable than the vast majority of cars, I sometimes simply say -- why bother (""sometimes"" I say this.)"
1485,"January 21, 2015 7:34AM",qbrozen,"Yeah, I have absolutely no intention of tuning my caddy. The only time I would ever see the results would be at the track, so its just not worth it."
1486,"January 21, 2015 7:42AM",graphicguy,"Mark:

I had a tune done to my '11 335i coupe. But, it was factory sanctioned and warranted, done by the dealer.It bumped up HP and torque roughly 10%. It changed the sound of the I6 turbo motor, too (for the better). Not sure that last part matters any more, though. Car manufacturers are given to pipe whatever sound they think their engines should make with noise generators through your stereo or with a resonator tapped into the firewall.

Q.....funny, given my car shoice (and the regularity with which I change them), I'm often asked if I trace my cars be neighbors. I don't, at least not any more. It's not that I don't want to. It's that burning up brakes and/or tires every few months, messing with sophosticated suspensions (like the CTS's MRC), etc isn't something I want to do to a $45K, $50K, $60K car....one that I rely on as a daily driver.

If you track your V, I'll come watch, though."
1487,"January 21, 2015 8:55AM",qbrozen,"I want to, I plan to, when I can afford it. Unfortunately, I never did take my mustang to the track while I owned it. We took a big vacation last summer instead, so I didn't feel comfortable burning the money on a track trip. Who knows what this year will bring?"
1488,"January 21, 2015 10:08AM",roadburner,"My modifications to the MS3 have been ridiculously cheap. I spent just $545 for a new Mazdaspeed intake and $230 for a used Hypertech tuner- which pumped up the motor to 310 hp and 324 lb-ft of torque. A stronger/stiffer rear motor mount from the Focus ST was a whopping $59.97.

The suspension work set me back $1780- but that number includes an adjustable rear anti-roll bar with billet mounts, Koni FSDs with new strut mounts, strut bearings, and bump stops, and a set of OEM take-offs for my summer tires(Michelin Pilot Super Sports which I won for being a Street Survival coach).

So, for just $2,345 I have a car that keeps me entertained until I can find a RWD toy that is actually close to fast(0-100 in 10.5 seconds or less, VIR lap time of no more than 3.10 seconds)."

1492,"January 22, 2015 2:11PM",andres3,"I finally got to track my big heavy S4 and my only complaints don't involve power; there was plenty of that. The problem was weight, high speeds from all that power, and OEM brake pads. I went through 7 or 8 mm of front OEM pad in one weekend, and ruined my front rotors in the process (and blew a rubber gasket on the caliper too). I drove the snot out of the car, and it was fun, but I was left wanting more braking power. Went with the Hawk blue box HPS pads, as I'm told the OEM S4 pads are designed for A4's and their typical drivers, in frozen weather for the NE USA. Not for warm Southern CA tracks. Shame on me for assuming S4's had better brake pads than A4's.

So my brake pads killed my rotors at 15K miles. Lesson learned. Also got better Motul 600 brake fluid."
1493,"January 22, 2015 2:47PM",qbrozen,"I did exactly that setup on my 135i and ate through the pads in one 2-day HPDE. The stock pads, in comparison, lasted me 2 such events and still had life left in them."
1494,"January 22, 2015 11:26PM",andres3,"If I recall, the 135i weight advantage over the 335i is fairly small right? If I would have skipped the last 2 sessions I wonder if my rotors would have been restorable to specs. The tracks are a long drive from San Diego and I track only 2 weekends (max) per year, so I had to abuse the brakes and rotors and risk loss of brake power which can be scary.

One fun thing is I had a full brake fluid reservoir and was able to pull enough G force on some turns that my ""BRAKE"" light indicator would come on briefly. Annoying multiple chimes with it though. Eventually I was able to figure out the G forces were making the fluid move enough that it triggered the low fluid sensor. I added a little bit and that solved the problem for most of the weekend."
1495,"January 23, 2015 8:48AM",qbrozen,"My challenge, and why I tried different fluids and pads, was that the brake pedal would get really spongy after a couple of fast laps. Took me a couple HPDEs, but I finally figured out what the problem was. The TCS on that car had 3 settings. On; 1 push to turn off the TCS but leave on stability control; and hold it for a few secs to turn everything off. The middle setting was supposed to let you have some fun without letting it get out of hand. Well, after new fluid and pads didn't fix it, I realized that every time I would touch the curbing, it was trying to use the active rear diff (which involves braking one rear tire on that car) to ""straighten"" me out. I finally decided to give a session a shot with it fully off. It pulled out of the turns better since it wasn't holding me back anymore, and the pedal no longer went soft. Huge difference."

The TLX 2.4 was tested by Motor Trend with a 0-60 time of 7.2. But since the ILX will almost certainly weigh about 500 pounds less, I'm thinking that the new ILX will really be quite a performer for the price. It's expected to start at c. $28k msrp."
1501,"January 30, 2015 8:00AM",graphicguy,"Yeah....that's a lot of time to pass. I hear that BMW is revamping all of their drivetrains in that time. Audi's current A/S/4s are getting long in the tooth (although, one could make a case that at least the S4 is still running with the pack).

I'll at least drive the Jag.

After straying from German and Japanes luxury iron back into the American waters with the CTS, I'm absolutely amazed the amount of performance, technology, robust build, high quality, etc that the Folks at Cadillac have been able to come up with.

As I was talking with another enhtusiast that other day, I mentioned this point. I also noted that perhaps it's not so amazing, given GM's debt was wiped off the books, the crustacean period management was shown the door, and listening more to the customers than the accountants would produce. Clean sheet, with all the engineering talent GM has, we're seeing some pretty nice resuts. My best freind has a new Corvette Sting Rey.....MERCY! Porsche who? While a bit small for my tastes, I test drove an ATS. Now THAT is a fun drive.

Ben....I love me some Acuras. And, while improvements to the ILX sound promising, Acura seems to have transformed into a premium SUV company. I liked the TLX I had the opportunity I test drove. But, the hotly contested $45K-$50K market is strewn with gerat cars that offer some pretty potent entres.

Heck, the wife's Accord EX-L is prett darn nice....as a performer, as a tech car, great build, good materials. We looked at the ILX and couldn't make the case for it given the Accord, all loaded up, was cheaper. One could say that the Accord V6 butts heads with the TLX. I became smitten with the SH AWD version of the TL (and that version was world class). But, even there, Acura didn't move the bar forward from the previous version. At the end of the day, I preferred the TL SH AWD to the TLX SH AWD. That's not a good thing when you're trying to sell your new iron."

1511,"February 4, 2015 7:10AM",graphicguy,"Had a chance to drive an S3 while I was in Indianapolis about a week ago. I usually don't do test drives unless I'm at least contemplating a car, which I'm not. But, as visiting my sister and on the way, with some time to kill, I passed an Audi dealer. Pulled in and saw they had 3 S3s. Dealer plate on and away we went.

Fast car. A little small, but it reminded me of the A4 from probably 5 or 6 model years ago. Having owned the S4, the controls were all familiar. If I could only use one word to describe it? HIGHSTRUNG. If feels like it always wants to race. Suspension dances on the line between harsh and firm but never quite crosses over to harsh. You know it's working.....all the time, though. Seat of the pants performance tells me it's about the same as the S4. DSG was fun. Engine gets on the boil right now.

The good news...the quattro system didn't bind like it did with my S4. It operated seamlessly. The bad news is it reminds me of some of the GM cars from the '90s. ""yeah....we can make a suspension that will corner....you'll have to put up with a ride that makes you tired and hurt your butt, but it can be done"". The suspesnion of the S3 just wears you out on anything other than glass smooth roads. The S4 would still be the way I'd go, for the better suspension alone, but the S3 would make me think twice given the price difference.

If I had to go German, and I wanted a fast German sports car, I'd probably save myself a lot of money and go with the Audi's younger sibling.....the VW GTI.

Or, step up the ladder and pay all the money and get a 2/335ix."

1513,"February 4, 2015 8:56AM",andres3,"You'll have to settle for the Golf R for a stick option. If you ask me, it's a fairly decent bargain since it isn't detuned mechanically. I still think the Audi interior and longer warranty and better customer service is worth at least a few grand, so it's a toss up depending on what you value. From what I've seen, there's better quality control in Ingolstadt than Mexico.

I found the S4 to be stronger ""seat of the pants"" than the S3 though. 7th gear on the DSG is worth it too.

Now, if they could just re-release the S4 being 300 lbs. lighter it would be perfect."
1514,"February 4, 2015 8:59AM",andres3,"I need to ask, what are/were the symptoms of the ""binding"" Quattro AWD system in your S4? How did you notice it? Did it happen every time? occasionally? Did it worsen over time?

Details please.

Maybe that's what made you not get all the BANG you paid for in the S4, because I'm surprised you felt the S3 just as quick (I know the 0-60 times tend to agree with you), but the S4 is underrated, and did you ever use the ""launch control technique"" described in the manual?"
1515,"February 4, 2015 9:08AM",graphicguy,"kyfdx...no stick on the S3 (at least that's what the sales person said). The MSRP on the one I drove, which was fairly loaded up (but you could add even more) was knocking on the $50K door, but you could still add more to it.

You can get a 235ix for that money, which can be had with a manual transmision, handles as well and has a more liveable suspension.

Seem a little sour to the s4/ audi experience - I too would love to see the pricing on this new v. I could never go V because it's rwd- my guess you would have issues too in Ohio winters .- numbers unreal 450/ sub 4 to 60.

1521,"February 9, 2015 7:13AM",dino001,"I recall Audi used to sell 4-year maintenance package for around $500 (A4 price). With $300 right out of the gate, this would have been a bargain. It was even more attractive with lease as it increased the residual by couple of percent, too. Do they still do that, or did their prices increased?"
1522,"February 9, 2015 7:46AM",kyfdx,"The price is around $850 for 3 years... On a lease, it adds 1% to the residual, so the actual cost is closer to $400.. Which is pretty cheap for three years of scheduled maintenance."

Soured on Audi? Probably more than a little truth in that statement. Still, the S3 is something other than a refined piece in my estimation. Personally, I'd skip it for $50K and get the S4 for around the same money. Or, the afore mentioned M235i or the ATS-V. Save a bit and get a GTI or R. Either would be more livable and you'd be able to stuff some green back into your pocket.

Ohio winters really aren't that bad, at least not compared to Boston, Chicago or New York. In the southern part of Ohio, we get a couple of dustings most winters. Every 3rd or 4th year, something more ""wintery"" happens, but I can live with that.

I have business colleagues who live in and around San Francisco. I tell them all the time, their winters can be difficult to drive in, too. They don't get any snow, but the Bay Area is wet and cold most of the winter. Not fun to drive in because their traffic is so much worse.

I like AWD installed in FWD platforms because it curbs some of the issues inherent in FWD cars. RWD doesn't have any of that. So, slap on some snow tires in the winter (just in case) and I'd be good to go."
1524,"February 9, 2015 8:55AM",roadburner,I have always run winter tires on my wife's BMW. She's had two 3ers and one 5er and we've nevr had any trouble.

1525,"February 9, 2015 5:50PM",markcincinnati,"The loaded S3 I test drove did indeed seem to just cross into the harsh ride category. The interior at freeway legal speeds seemed to show off its lack of sound deadening, too. A drive from Cincinnati to Cleveland would probably be wearying.

The performance was very impressive -- the thing was super willing to be at full cry seemingly in one second. The handling -- this one had the magnetic suspension option -- was confidence inspiring. The transmission was great -- better than any manual, BUT it was the 6-speed version. The 7-speed seems like it would be a better choice due to the addition of another overdriven gear.

The audio system was very good, not knock your socks off good, but premium ""enough."" That stupid pop up nav screen looks like one of those after market units (from Pioneer) from decades ago. Don't know why Audi chose to do that, when they had the built in look down to a science. But, that is personal preference.

For a change, Porsche now does the integration of the Nav.infotainment system better than Audi. What a world/

At a north of $50K price, the S4 (at least today's S4) seems like a bargain compared to the S3.. Of course a stripped S3 makes a strong performance argument, but, sadly, the premium-ness has been dialed way down. The interior is almost austere -- but perhaps minimalism is the look they were going for.

I would never get a black on black one -- the interior felt like a little teeny weenie cave -- a lighter color would have certainly upped the luxury/premium quotient.

Audi will sell as many of these as they can mint -- I would assume the market for the S3 would have to top out around mid-30;s (age wise). If you can afford an S3, you can afford an S4 and probably even a nicely equipped 3-series (without the i6 engine, however.) You can certainly afford a maxed out A4 SLine -- which wouldn't have the stump pulling torque, but it would have the 8 speed trans a less jittery sport suspension and actually FEEL like a premium car.

I am clearly not the S3 (or A3) target market. Hell, I'm scheming for an S6 -- and hoping for an improved and all new S4 in a year or two from now.

Drive it like YOU live."

1527,"February 9, 2015 7:34PM",benjaminh,"Good reviews so far for the 2016 Acura ILX with the 2.4 DI engine (201 hp) and the 8 speed dual clutch transmission with torque converter. Starting msrp: $28k, undercutting the Audi A3 by $2k while getting to 60 more than a second faster....

From Motor Trend:

""Acura lost the 2.0-liter engine and dropped in a 2.4-liter, direct injection, 16-valve four-cylinder engine that creates 201 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque. It also introduces the first dual-clutch eight-speed automatic transmission with a torque converter and paddle shifters that seem to always know the right gear at the right time. It launches with aggressive power, and once first gear winds out, it quickly shifts and maintains that torque until you let off the gas. There's a touch of torque steer to pull you to the right under heavy acceleration off the line, but that quickly disappears and leaves you with a compact rocket on the road.

The electric power steering is taut and very linear, snapping back to center with ease. Driving around Napa, California's, winding mountain roads, the ILX kept its line through every corner and never let up. It's smooth but feels quick and allowed me a chance to make my driving partner just a little bit carsick after a few twisty corners. Acura also improved the car's braking, allowing it to remain smooth and quick. For those who want the car to do the driving for you, the ILX offers adaptive cruise control and lane-keep assist. I'm not particularly fond of the lane-keep assist system, because it seems to work even when I didn't want it to, pulling me back to the center of the lane during faster driving, but I should have merely turned it off then. On the highway, it does a nice job of smoothly adjusting the car back to the middle of the lane.

Acura added a number of quieting technologies in the car, including active noise cancelation and additional deadening materials. This was quite noticeable. The car is remarkably quiet, especially considering it's built on the Civic platform, which is not the quietest compact around. A quiet ride remains one of the hallmarks of luxury, and the ILX allows for easy conversations at any speed. The interior improvements are just as noticeable as the exterior ones. There are steps up in the quality of materials, the soft dash, and nicely done stitching throughout the cabin. (The A-Spec model includes aluminum floor pedals and special seat inserts.) There are all of the regular luxury items, such as a moonroof, a clean instrument cluster, and comfortable heated seats. When you sit down in this car, you notice that it's nicely done."""
1528,"February 9, 2015 7:35PM",benjaminh,"Another review of the 2016 ILX by Left Lane News:

""Cruising along the Silverado trail in Napa, California, gave us a quick taste of the ILX's improvements. From the moment we pushed the red starter button, we could see that Acura had corrected many of the motivational issues that plagued the last car. And to their credit, Acura executives acknowledged as much, when during the presentation about the vehicle's new features, they stated that they had taken many an expert's comments to heart.

In addition to the lack of power, one of the bigger complaints of the previous version was the excessive road noise that made its way into the cabin. The NVH guys got it right this time, utilizing tricks and techniques that made a huge difference that was quantifiable in back-to-back tests.

For 2016, buyers will get a taste of just what 51 extra horsepower and an additional 40 lb-ft of torque are capable of, especially in a car that weighs only 3,100 pounds. We found a compact four-door sedan that offered up just the right amount of torque steer when we launched from a standing start. They didn't post exact times but Acura officials state the ILX gets to 60 mph 2.5-seconds faster than the model it replaces. And that was in the normal drive mode. Switching over to sport mode allowed us to put the paddle shift levers to good use as we blipped our way up through the eight-speed gearbox. Offering a different feel then that found in the normal drive mode, it allowed us to hold our gears as long as we wanted while negotiating the twisties in Northern California's wine country."""
1529,"February 9, 2015 8:20PM",sweendogy,"Couple of things - first s3 thought some of you would like this mashup 


the other news on the ILX reviews above/ @benjineh how long have you worked for acura ? So it undercuts the a3 in zero to 60 time and price - what a3 are you talking of? the 1.8 fwd or the mainstream 2.0 with quatro- are they really in the same class? I mean we had this arguement before with the Tsx vs the g35, bmw 328 and others but it was nowhere close- remind you that acura has badicay been dead since the integra left us-"
1530,"February 9, 2015 8:48PM",roadburner,"The M235i is the only sub-$50k BMW I would put in my driveway. My Audi dealer pretty much soured me on the marque due to the aggravation they caused every time I've tried to deal with them(I didn't want an Audi, but my wife was interested in an A4Q).

By the way, those ""experts"" in the video should know that-on this side of the pond, anyway- a ""Bimmer"" is a BMW car and a ""Beemer"" is a BMW bike..."
1531,"February 9, 2015 9:20PM",stickguy,"Ben, thanks for that. I saw the piece in MT I think. See, this now sounds like the car I should have waited for. Exactly what my wish list it pretty much. I really liked the interior and size. Upping the speed and driving experience is all that it really needed. and if they kept the price the same, it should be a very good deal.

Actually, it sounds more like the original tsx, which it probably is close in size to. and that car I always loved.

Too bad I already got something. But heck, I'll still stop in to take a look when they finally come out. Plan ahead I always say!

I am sure the comparison was to the FWD 1.8 A3. which makes sense, because they are closest in concept and price. Not really comparable to a 40K 2.0t model."
1532,"February 10, 2015 7:03AM",graphicguy,"Read a blurb yesterday stating that Acura is getting ready to bring back turbo 4 cyl motors (which seems to be the price to play in the premium segment). and it's speculated that one will land in the ILX. Wife tried one before settling on the Accord. Tough sell. Small, underpowered, and more expensive than her loaded Accord. Hard to make that fly.

I did like the TLX. But, I didn't like it as well as the TL. So, no go there, too. RLX? Should have saved development money and killed it off. It's barely selling as well as the previous dismal RL. My hope is that there's something Acura is planning (maybe the turbo 4 in the TLX) like a TLX-S because as it stands right now, they're an SUV brand, who happens to throw a few cars in the showroom just in case you need one of those, too.

No secret that Audi just seems to confound their customers...whether it's ""Sween's"" $300 oil change, or them playing ""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil"" about the problems my S4 had. Troubling enough it was on the dealer level. Worse, the Audi factory team weren't any better. That attitude eventually catches up to you. You'd think their customer service would be a lot better given how they were almost wiped out of existence in the '80s with the hatchet job they got with unintended acceleration.

S3 will sell. Not sure the age group. It gives a lot of performance. But, those it's targeting are raising families. Is it big enough? For $50K is it really nice enough?? Interior was underwhelming, as Mark pointed out. The materials were not what I'd consider worthy of a $35K car, let alone a $50K car. And, it seems to be a German thing, but who was it that decided a stuck on LCD screen sticking up in the middle of the dash was a ""new trend""? Somebody in their design dept needs a serious remedial course in aesthetics.

Even if a childless couple ends up liking the S3, not sure it's demeanor will appeal given some alternatives who have sharp handling, and a more sophisticated ride. My money? Stuck in an Audi showroom with no other competitor to be found within 1,000 miles? I'd write the check for the S4 for about the same money. Better car, better interior, better suspension, better transmission, better engine....better all the way around.

BMW? Cadillac? VW? Any of those dealers close? I'd be sticking my checkbook back in my pocket and looking at those over the Audi.

Even Mercedes, which has given up its chase to be a sharp performer, puts out a decent product in the $50K range...C Class. Aside from the silly stick up screen (again), it has a nice interior and makes no apologies that it rides nice, while maybe not offering the last 10th in handling or performance.

Buy, the CLA's suspension is every bit as ragged as the Audi's. Interior is....ummm....interesting. Not nearly as nice as the ATS nor an uber conservative 2 or 3 Series. But, it has a star on the front. So, for many, that's all that's needed.

I liked my Audi...when I drove it off the showroom floor. It became troublesome almost immediately. When the dealer stone walls you (and I'm not the only person who's had that happen in these parts), it makes a frustrating situation unbearable. So long Audi.

Had sterling customer service from BMW, and again with my CTS. Need an oil change? New wipers? Got a little parking lot ding? No problem. Leave it with the dealership, who gladly gives you a loaner to use, only to get your car back later all clean and shiny with everything taken care of.....NO CHARGE!

Geez.....that got long winded. I don't have any catchy sign off phrases (wish I did). Ciao!"

The local BMW/Mini dealer (not the one in the TV report) had a very bad rep for customer service but has recently been sold to one of the two local dealer groups, the same one I bought my ATS from, who probably will be better.

Not to resort to arm twisting to get you to buy or become deaf to your communications when talking about issues with your car.

My BMW, Acura, and now my Cadillac dealer can't do enough to listen and respond to what I communicate. My Audi dealer couldn't do too little in response to the same. Guess which dealerships I'll contact first when I decide to get another vehicle? Pretty easy answer."
1540,"February 10, 2015 5:41PM",benjaminh,"As you say, I'm comparing the Audi A3 1.8 with the 2016 Acura TLX 2.4.

Car and Driver seems to put the A3 1.8 0-60 at 7.3, while the 2016 TLX C&D puts at 6.2. One second faster is a pretty significant difference.

When these two models are comparably equipped with leather, heated seats, backup camera, etc. I think the Audi goes for about $33k while the TLX goes for about 3k less. The Audi has more prestige and arguably nicer interior design, but the Acura is quite a bit faster and might even have better handling around corners. At least one test of the A3 1.8 that I saw complained about excessive roll and lean around corners. Plus, I think most would agree that for long term reliability an Acura beats an Audi.

Here's what Auto Week says at the end of it's review:

If you’re looking for an entry-level sports sedan, you’ll definitely want to consider the 2016 ILX now. The new drivetrain has done wonders for Acura’s gateway vehicle, giving it adequate muscle to make a stand against the Audi A3 and Mercedes-Benz CLA. The engine is potent and is definitely a throwback to Honda/Acura 4-cylinders of old that once powered vehicles like the Acura Integra and Honda Prelude.

Handling will also remind you a little of the brand’s sportier performers from the past, which should be music to a Honda/Acura fan’s ears.

1541,"February 10, 2015 6:08PM",robr2,"I have found that to have a great relationship with a dealer's service department, is simply to be nice. Most of my dealings are with the same service adviser at the Honda, VW and Ford dealerships. I go in with a good attitude. If there is a problem with the service work, they know I will come to them personally and not burn them on a survey. I try to be reasonable knowing that they very often have no control over the issue.

Lastly, I write a letter - not an e-mail or facebook post - to the owner principal and the service manager praising the service adviser. Next time I'm in, they fall all over me."

1543,"February 10, 2015 7:19PM",markcincinnati,"Assuming my comments are not banned: We have two Audi dealerships in Cincinnati. I have dealt with both of them, but purchased every one of our Audis from one dealership -- now called The Audi Connection.

We have two BMW dealerships, too. Purchased three Bimmers from one of them -- The BMW Store -- over the years.

These two dealerships -- the ones that we have purchased from have been wonderful to deal with from a sales perspective AND a service perspective. Out of more than two dozen Audis we have had, we did have one that was problematic (actually the brakes were the issue). Audi of America sent their area representative to help out the situation. As usual, the dealer was helpful in making such a thing happen.

OK, I get it -- your mileage may differ. I agree with whoever said -- get rid of the bad ones (or words to that effect). No mfgr can tolerate even a very small number of crappy dealers. The Internet spreads the tales of woe like a Cancer. I know dealers are often local business people, not mega corporations -- although this is changing, in the era of the $1B dealership ""groups.""

The dealer can do harm, sometimes great harm to a brand -- and god knows Audi can't afford a sub-par dealer. No mfgr can.

If you need to buy or lease a new Audi and you are within 250 miles of Cincinnati, you can certainly buy one here -- but that probably does you little good with respect to service after the sale. You need a relationship with your dealer somewhat like your relationship with your ""barber"" (or hair dresser if you don't like the term barber). Of course, if you don't work at the relationship too, it won't pan out favorably, probably.

My Audi service mgr and I have been on a first name basis for perhaps 15 years -- our sales rep, in his mid-80's finally retired; he had been at the dealership since the discovery of dirt. Our new guy only has 12+ years with the dealer, he is so new he's still learning where the restroom is.

The time on the job of the various players at the dealership is a huge clue. If the lot tech guy and your sales rep have about the same tenure, you'd be better off finding out the tenure, overall, of the reps. Ditto the shop people, shop foreman, service manager and service writers. My service adviser has been at the dealership for at least a decade.

The Audi Connection is the poster child for what a dealership should look like. The BMW Store has a similar tenure with its people and the dealer experience is all the better for it.

If you have a bad dealer, I do feel for you -- if you can, get the hell away from them."

In some ways perhaps the Germans are ahead of the 2016 ILX. For instance, the A3 seems to have nicer interior design. And the BWM 320i, of course, is sure to have better handling.

But the Audi A3 under the skin has a lot in common with a $20k VW Golf. That doesn't seem different to me than an ILX having some common bones with a $20k Honda Civic. They take these bones, reinforce them, put new skins on them, put new engines in them, etc. Well, I'm not so sure about the engine for the A3, now that I think about it. Isn't that basically the new standard Golf 1.8 turbo engine? Not sure.

A turbo for the ILX might be nice, but I think the ILX 2.4 is already beating all of its competition with the base engines in terms of 0-60. And the competition isn't really weak, and so that seems plenty powerful enough for the likes of me.

And when it comes to reliability and long term ownership, many would take an Acura over an Audi or MB. If you're just leasing and want the prestige, then the others are probably better choices. But if you're actually buying it for yourself and plan on keeping it, then Lexus, Acura, etc., might have an edge there."

My wife is a lot more forgiving than I am when it comes to customer service. She's the one who is willing to give the benefit of the doubt. Me? I don't care if it's my real estate agent, my stock broker, my car sales person, or even my landscaper,

Car dealerships (and in turn, car manufacturers) expect me to live up to my commitment when buying a car to pull 10s of thousands of dollars out of my wallet for their product. I expect that they live up to their promise that the car will operate as they said it would. And, if it doesn't, I expect them to make it right without pushback. That last part is where Audi got in trouble.

The dealership Mark is referring to was actually at least moderately helpful, but still unwilling or unable (maybe both) to fix the car. Their Service Manager said the DSG trans and components of the Quattro system needed to be replaced. In a moment of unusual honesty, he said that Audi had a problem with some of the components for the drivetrain that were out of spec. He thought he'd get the green light to do the repair. That authorization never happened. The service manager said at one point that the Regional Audi Rep told him the car was too expensive to fix. Not that it couldn't be fixed, but that he thought it costs too much to fix it. Really? I mean REALLY? Guess what? It was 4X more expensive to buy back and label the car as a corporate buy back.

It wasn't just me with the issues. One of the trade rags I read after they bought mine back, mentioned the same issue. I looked for recalls. Never saw any.

The Audi Customer Service people suggested I take it to the other Audi dealer in town. I have no proof, but I think they looked at it, test drove it, called the Region, got stonwalled and essentially just changed the trans fluid. Clearly, that wasn't the problem as it still existed as I drove it away from their service bay. Took it back to them a 2nd time. Can't remember what they actually did, but it didn't fix the problem.

At that point, Audi had the car for a total of about 6+ weeks. They came back and said lemon law didn't apply because I had the car in for two separate issues. It was the same issue, that needed two fixes....Quattro and DSG. I don't know what they thought....perhaps I was just going to forget about it?

Icing on the cake....called Audi Customer Care (allegedly a Supervisor who had been assigned to my case), who proceeded to tell me the reason none of the local Audi dealerships would service my car, was because I didn't buy it from them. Uhhhhh.....izzatright? That's not what both of the Audi dealers told me. Game on. You're buying the car back, which they ended up doing.

I told Mark's dealer what I thought could have/should have happened. They should have either replaced the trans and Quattro components. Or, they should have just swapped the car for one that worked correctly. Neither was offered....and believe me, I did ask. They wanted me to take a about a $10K hit to swap out the car, though. Yeah....that's really fair!

As far as the Caddy? I'm not expecting the same resale percentage numbers I was used to getting with my Acuras 9which were exemplary). That said, I bought it right ($15K and change dff MSRP). So, I took the good deal up front with getting a great deal instead of on the back end when it comes trade time."
1548,"February 11, 2015 8:46AM",graphicguy,"Mark....I think the Audi Connection could be a very good dealership. I think they were hampered by their Regional Rep. Plus, neither them nor the one on Beechmont could come close to the deal I got out of the Chicago Audi Dealership (Westmont). We're not talking about a deal that was a few hundred better....we're talking about a deal that was a few thousands as the delta (I think it was about $3K difference). I gave both the opportunity to get close...even gave them a little working room given I'd save the time to drive to Chicago and back home again. The Chicago dealer bought me dinner and paid for a hotel room near their dealership. I can't even imagine either Cincinnati dealer doing that.

Went to Dayton Audi store, too. They were more like the old ""let me get my manager to see if we can make a deal"". After waiting 30 minutes for this manager to show up, I left their store. Sales person tried to stall me more, but enough was enough.

BMW Store is good. They never seem to have what I want. They have a pretty rigid set of criteria of cars they order from Stuttgart. They seem to get a lot of base models with base drivetrains. I tend to want the ones with the bigger, better drivetrains, which Sweeney always seems to have. I have a personal relationship with ""my guy"" at Sweeney BMW, though. He's been there for probably 20+ years. I've bought 3 BMWs from him. Deal is always skinny, and simple. Anything I've ever had go wrong, it's taken care of. No questions, no pushback, no fuss, no muss. No issue is too small for them (nor too large).

We're not so different. We deal with people we trust. I think that's true of most people."

About 30 days later, the thermostat went. It requires just about the same labor time to reach the tstat as to get to the timing belt. I mentioned it to the service manager and he went through my customer history. He noted how much I've spent there, if I was asked if I wanted to change the tstat when they did the timing belt and I'm sure somewhere in there is my CSI report. Viola - 3 hour labor credit."

I drove the TLX. Nice car. Not the same driving experience as the TL-S models or even the SH AWD TL that I had. Admittedly, I like the look of the new one better than the old one, but didn't have an issue with the ""beak"" look that others did.

Truth told, if Audi had just fixed my S4, I'd still be in the fold. Instead, they lost me. I have to believe I'm smack dab in the wheelhouse of their demographic, too.

Bang for the buck, an S4 is hard to beat.

But, as these things go, every body is stealing from everyone else. My CTS AWD has the trick torque vectoring rear that the Audi Quattro and Acura TL SH AWD have. My CTS has the twin scroll turbo that the BMW 4 cyl has (and more power to boot). Get the V-Sport (last year could be had for high $40s). and you get the 6 cyl with two turbos...wicked fast.

Took a couple of weeks, but once I got used to CUE, I ""get it"". And, I like it. My understanding is they went through a couple of interim updates to get it to this point, though.

ILX needs that turbo motor. Otherwise, stick with a Civic.

The Civic and Accord are great cars. Are their Acura counterparts worth $X,ooo more? It's not clear cut. So I guess that's pretty telling.

That said, I loved all the Acura I've had. Not sure they shouldn't just go ahead and just be an upscale SUV brand and be done with it. Maybe they're hoping the new NSX will breathe life into their car sales. The ILX and the TLX both need that turbo 4, though. The TLX, in particular, looks like a took a step back going from the sweet 3.7L in the previous gen SH AWD version to the 3.5L in the current car. Not sure what the thought process was there. In the tech dept, where they used to be at the forefront, they're now lagging behind, even with a totally new refresh.

BTW....here's my BMW dealer......http://www.sweeneybmw.com/index.htm


FN....if the prospect of getting $15K+ off a CTS wasn't out there, no way I would have entered the Cadillac showroom. My issues with Cadillac came before the GM ""purge"". I think the Cadillac dealers had to get into shape or the prospect of GM cutting them became quite real. That was very evident in my experiences with the same dealership 11 years ago, and the experience with them now. Truly, it was a night and day difference.

Drove the ATS. Thought it was a really fun car. A tad small for my tastes (reminded me of the A3, sidewise). Drove the CTS, and had as much fun, only with all the trappings of an E Class, A6, 5 Series......a better suspension than any of those, with better steering, braking, etc. A Cadillac....right? Who'd have thunk it.

Frankly, if I didn't get such a good deal on the CTS, I would have been targeting an IS350 F-Sport, probably this summer. That's a fun car, too. A little on the snug side (and I'm not a big guy)."

I got them to give me 15% off because even at 10% off I felt as I was being ripped off (I originally thought 15K service included a new engine air filter at least; it doesn't!).

1565,"February 13, 2015 7:24AM",markcincinnati,"I have a question (prompted by an article I read about the RS7): Audi, today, uses the DSG transmission on the S4, S5, S6 and S7, for instance. Yet on the RS7 they use the 8-speed Tiptronic. The stated reason is that the currently available DSG can't take the forces generated by the RS7's engine. The article said the S6 was on the cusp of stressing the DSG -- and owners of an S6 were cautioned not to after-market upgrade the HP and torque (which is quite possible with the turbo S6 V8, e.g.).

Can the DSG in the S4 handle the upgrade you are contemplating and have a good long life? If not, what is the cost -- or risk in this upgrade?

My dealer says the S4 is going to have a horsepower and torque boost to keep it ahead of the standard V6T in the 2016 A6 line. It means, to me, that they have resolved the DSG issue; wonder if there is the headroom in the current DSG to take the upgrade is my concern."

Given the R8 has switched and upgraded to a dual clutch DSG unit, I think they've resolved any issues with the DSG and power/torque. I'm not too worried about it.

I have no problem at all with you upgrading your engine, knowing that the transmission will attempt to protect itself when it is pushed beyond its comfort zone. I don't have the money that it would take to self insure against the risk.

Frankly, I think it would be less costly to get a new ""S"" with the uprated engine -- when it comes out perhaps as a 2016 -- rather than push the DSG with the upgrade.

Of course, if you upgrade and nothing untoward goes down, well your risk will have been proven to be low.

My experience with ""chipping"" is perhaps why I am concerned -- I chipped my wife's TT and the power and acceleration were thrilling -- but the damn thing went from being reliable (and I assume durable) to needing constant visits to the dealer for things that seemed to have started coincidentally with the chip's installation.

My A3 mods did the opposite of souring me on mods. If anything though, I felt they over advertised the power improvements , or at least overstated them, didn't pass the butt dyno.

I can understand being soured to tuning if you've had issues in the past. However, if the car was old, maybe it was just due to have those same failures anyway? Also, what kind of tune (company?) was it. I got Unitronics with the A3, and part of their sales spiel is that they tune it with OEM like reliability and durability in mind. Of course, my S4 tune will be Revo, so new territory. I find the Audi components to be over engineered so that they can handle these tunes with ease if done right."

So, drove through some blizzard conditions Saturday night! The XF was a rock star, AWD/All Seasons tracked steady and true. Stopped for dinner in York, pulled up restaurants on the Nav, told son to pick one. I guess I missed the turn as we found ourselves driving through residential, one lane (due to snow) roads that hadn't been plowed recently. So, probably 6+"" snow, no problem for the XF! Used the rear foglight, oversight on Jag's part, no front fogs... One hour dinner, 2+"" new snow on top of the car! But, light and fluffy.

Woke up Sunday expecting a plethora of fresh powder to ski...and nothing. It didn't snow the entire four days we were there. The wind did howl mightily, though. Kept lifts closed, so 3 days of skiing turned into more like 1.5. Probably good for me, skied trees and bumps. I ain't 16 like my son. Oh, my achin' back!"

The car kills it in light snow and is fun to get a little sideways. Im afraid to hit the gas when the snow gets deeper or at night. The video above I have seen before highlights Quattro but also brute force of a beast tuned car - if you had a 500 hp subi it would do the same in similar snow.

I still see plenty of the Q50's predecessor, the G37X, on the road -- and they have kept the thing alive as a Q40.

I also see plenty of the larger Infinitis on the road -- but the Q50s sit and sit and sit on the dealer's lots.

My wife says they are soul-less machines. I actually like the Q50's styling -- but the engine is basically unchanged from the previous G's and the transmission isn't as good of a partner as you could want and as you certainly expect -- at MSRP. But subvented, well the mo/pay has to make the Q50 attractive.

I always thought of BMW as the German Infiniti -- perhaps the incentives will gin up some greater enthusiasm for the Brand and the model.

Maybe there's something rotten in Hong Kong (or Tokyo); maybe that's why Audi's former US President spent to little time with Infiniti and jumped to Cadillac before the paint in his new Hong Kong office dried."

But still, it's a tough row to hoe when you swing and miss with a product redesign.

The fact that they're still selling the previous G series speaks volumes about how the Q 50 is doing. I test drove a Q50 a couple of times. Not sure the objective they were trying to meet, but whatever it was, they missed badly."
1619,"February 24, 2015 3:56PM",markcincinnati,"A sub-vented lease can be a better deal than buying for many folks.

Years back, Jaguars leased for STUPID numbers (very very low per month) -- the cars were discounted, but not enough to justify NOT leasing. The odd thing is the leases were closed ended which meant there was no risk for the person who leased with respect to residual value.

Here's how they did it (or at least how it was done by some mfgrs):

The lease price of the car is the cost of the use of the car for X months (lets say 24 or 36). To determine the lease, the financial arm went ahead and jacked up the residual value of the car to something IMPOSSIBLE let's say 70% of MSRP. Then they took the 30% of MSRP and divided it by 36 or whatever to come up with a crazy, artificially low (sub-vented) lease price per month. In some cases what they did was purchase an insurance policy to guarantee the 70% or at least some part of the 70%. Then they made the lease have a get out early penalty that pretty much meant you had little choice but to keep the car the full 36 months or you would pay through the nose. In some cases you actually had to keep the car -- you could NOT simply make the remaining payments to get off the hook.

Yet, for those that wanted an $80,000 (pick a car) for $399 per month with no money down, there was simply no way a purchase made any sense.

Now, Infiniti certainly does sub-vent, but not crazy crazy like the above mostly true example. The payment for the use of the car is indeed artificially low, but remember you are paying for the sub-vented cost of use of the car (which is less than you would pay had you purchased the car up front).

Then at the conclusion of the lease there is MAYBE the possibility of getting the car for its real, honest, market value -- not the bloated, made up residual. If the car is good and you can get it at real true market value in month 25 or 37 or whatever, you actually did get a good deal since all you paid for was the rental amount for the past 24 months anyway and it was, er, ""rent controlled.""

Infiniti's can be a bargain when they are helped along via the finance arm via a sub-venting process. As far as Acura's are concerned, their financial arm hasn't always been a flexible in that regard -- but perhaps it is because they didn't need to with the MDX being the lion's share of their business.

It seems to me the TLX (and I come from a TL and actually liked it) was/is a missed opportunity to de-Honda-ize the brand. At this point, however nice they are, they are, underneath, Prime Hondas. That is not a bad thing, but the thing that I always thought about Infiniti was that they really did attempt to build a car that could rival a BMW. Acuras are still sold as FWD vehicles (a big mistake if you axe me), the Infiniti in question here is, actually, really and truly, a rear wheel drive vehicle that can be had with AWD (very BMW-ish, there).

Moreover, don't go thinking Lexi are much more of an engineering tour de force vis a vis Toyota as Acuras are compared to Hondas.

But, so it seems, the market has spoken and the Infiniti cars are not the leaders of the pack, more like the laggards of the pack -- hence super-sub-venting to the rescue which may move more of them off the lots until a new and improved version can be screwed together for your inspection.

We bought our first car last year a $65,000+ Audi SQ5 -- we put $22,000 down, have a 2.25% APR note on it and it is now showing at being worth about $48K. We still owe $33K on it. We've lost, in my estimation, $7K -- had the thing been offered with a sub-venting finance package on a lease, well, that would have been a no-brainer. We're hoping the plummeting cash value of the car will, in year two, hit the brakes and that maybe we'll have a point in time where the car ""feels"" like it was a better decision to buy than to lease.

We'll see how it goes.

Meantime who cares what the car's MSRP is? Not most Americans. They, er, WE, only really care about the monthly payment.

When a $50K+ car can be had for $399 per month for the life of its warranty and then simply dropped off with no muss, no fuss, well that hardly seems like a BAD thing. Speaking of sub-venting, Cadillac is doing the same thing with their CTS and ATS and XTS vehicles as we speak."
1620,"February 24, 2015 5:18PM",flightnurse,"I think Acura still have problems, their two best sellers are the MDX and RDX, the MDX is long in the tooth and really isn't competitive in the market (but the lease payments are lower then the competition) and the RDX just got another refresh.. I liked Acura better when they had the Legend and Integra."
1621,"February 24, 2015 5:52PM",stickguy,"the MDX was just fully redesigned for 2015 (or was it 2014?). How did that get long in the tooth already? Plus I thought it was selling quite well. The RDX came out for 2013, so this is the normal time for it's mid-cycle refresh.

I wonder what the sales are on the TLX? I don't recall seeing any #s. It is a nice car, and certainly a good value. And $$ speak. I also think the refreshed 2016 ILX is going to help that model immensely. The RLX, however, is a lost cause."
1622,"February 24, 2015 5:59PM",graphicguy,"No disagreements with you or Mark. Test driving the Q50, it was like they couldn't make up their mind whether they wanted it to be a sports sedan or a luxury sedan and ended up with neither.

Acura is moving to the soft side like it seems every other alleged ELLSS (with the exception of Audi and Cadillac) is heading....soft. Still, Acura TLX is going to sell 45,000 TLXs in '15. Is there enough of a delta between an Accord and the TLX? Not sure. Drove a TLX. It drives differently from my wife's Accord. Enough to justify the price difference? I still like them. $45K at the tippy top end for a technologically rich, 6 cyl with AWD and torque vectoring rear seems pretty compelling."

1626,"February 25, 2015 7:09AM",graphicguy,"I just saw that the Honda President was either fired or resigned recently due to the airbag recalls, under reporting crash data, and a couple of other things. The article I read said he had navigated Honda/Acura through the Global recession, the tsunami in Japan (where a lot of vehicles were lost and manufacturing facilities were destroyed) as well as some other catastrophies.

I guess this means they don't really care what monumental obstacles you face, deliver to the bottom line or your gone.

Personally, I think Honda got away from what they did best with Acura. That is, be a leader in engineering, performance, design, technology and value in the luxury vertical. RLX (and the RL before that) hasn't been relevant for over a decade. As good as the TL is/was, it was not the most handsome car on the road. The new one is better. Acura really didn't have an answer for the Integra's demise.

By default, they became a luxury SUV company. It seems past those who view an Escalade as having ""made it"", the MDX is the lux SUV of choice with the upper middle class. I still like their products. Whether it was because they never did recover from the tsunami, they felt their brand would be better served by moving more towards the middle of the market, or whether they lost their desire to lead, they seem to just be missing the mark with their cars. I hope they continue to fire products at the segment because it's hard to find cars that are as well built, drive so nicely, are as bulletproof reliable, and are good values as my Acuras were. Unfortunately, that's not enough these days."
1627,"February 25, 2015 8:35AM",ab348,"I remember late '90s/early '00s, I thought of Acura as an aspirational brand, out of my price range at the time but something I might consider later on when I could afford one. Now they are not on my radar nor are they in any way appealing."

That said, they made a point that they liked the Buick Regal GS as a better luxury sports sedan than they do a BMW 328i. Pretty big leap there. But it does show how the American brands are roaring back into the Luxury/Sport arena.

I mentioned in another thread that the IS350 F Sport would have been on my radar before I pulled the trigger on the CTS. I was at the auto show locally last weekend and found the Lexus to feel a bit claustrophobic. The GS350 F Sport was much more to my liking.

So, I guess I'm moving away from the ELLPS vertical onto the next step."

I've owned both the S4 and the TL SH AWD. TL SH AWD is mighty close to the Audi. No, the TL wasn't as fast as the S4, but it was every bit as adept in the handling dept and was very confidence inspiring to drive. It matched the S4 in the feature category. Service costs on the TL vs the S4 were miniscule in comparison. MPG was certainly better on the TL vs the S4, too. And, for the money I paid (under $40K) for the TL SH AWD Advance it offered huge value.

Don't get me wrong, I liked my S4. Didn't like the reliability (lack thereof) of the S4 and didn't like the MPG, nor the maintenance costs, either."

1645,"February 28, 2015 11:17AM",markcincinnati,"I did like my TL SH-AWD Advance. I thought it was ugly, and the interior looked like a Honda that knew somebody. The air conditioned seats were great. The power was good, nothing to scare an S4. The brakes were very weak. The doors sounded tinny when closed. It was a beer to the Audi's champagne. Yet, much as most folks would never cross shop these two, it was Honda's bargain basement S4.

I have to assume the new TL is an improvement. Mine, a 2012, had way too much FWD feel (torque steer), something the S4 doesn't have.

I don't have the S's sport diff (torque vectoring rear diff), wish I did, but I would assume if I did, I'd love this thing even more.

This car and my wife's SQ5 have become our favorite Audis and our favorite cars -- and we've had dozens -- of all time. I want to say nothing even comes close -- but our BMW's have been close (and even a couple VW's were a blast to drive, but still none are the performers of these S's.) I used to think they (Audi S cars) were too expensive, but compared to 3-series, well it seems these Audis are ""within reach"" of most folks who shop and buy the cars discussed on this forum.

If you ""can't see"" or ""don't share"" our (my wife's and mine, i.e.) passion for the Audi S's, I would say the TL or TLX SH-AWD with anything that increases the performance/handling ticked off on the option list, is not a bad alternative (if you can get past the styling and the Honda content.) But, for the money, the Acura may be attractive to you because it will almost certainly stay south of $50K..

If you can't stomach the TLX's looks and the Audi leaves you wondering what I see in them, well, the C class Mercedes, too, looks like it is worth a second look -- and I've always had a soft spot for the Volvo S60 type R.

An observation: many who write here about their cars make remarks like ""my TL gave me 6 trouble free years."" My irreverent side almost always reads, ""my TL gave me 6 [bland, boring, unremarkable, invisible] trouble free years."" If I remarked to my wife that she has given me 20 plus years of trouble free cohabitation,"" she'd have every right to punch me in the nose.

I want 6 trouble free years, too, but I think I'd take 3 spectacular driving experience years instead.

That's why I always say: Drive it like YOU live. Life's too short to not have at least some trouble!"
1646,"February 28, 2015 12:16PM",markcincinnati,"Some may recall that when I wanted to go ahead and get a 2014 Lexus IS350F with every option box ticked off (in metallic white with red leather), my wife said, ""we tried the Infiniti and the Acura, it just seems that they ain't got no soul . . . "" We test drive cars and seek out new restaurants as damn near professions as any hobbies could ever be -- so when it came time to drop the Acura and Infiniti, we seriously went into test driving as THE weekend event for a few months.

Here is what we noticed: Audi, BMW, Porsche and (to a lesser extent) Mercedes owners participate in ""clubs,"" attend driving schools, take road trips en masse, make trips to Germany to visit the Holy Land (the factories where their cars are made) and spend a fair amount of their disposable incomes on logo'd shirts, coats, key-fobs, ball caps, wrist watches, wine glasses, beer mugs and other branded memorabillia. Acura, Infiniti and Lexus owners? Not so much.

So, maybe my wife was onto something -- data points suggest the above mentioned Germans attract buyers and have owners who are passionate (they have soul perhaps?) about their favorite car brands. Other than some key fobs and a narrow selection of ball caps, only the local Infiniti dealer even had a Branded Boutique of items touting their owners love of their brand's cars.

The BMW store, in Cincinnati, offers free car washes -- so what you say? Well, arrive at the BMW store bright and early on a Saturday morning and you will see a line of BMW's, perhaps 20 cars deep, waiting to be hand washed -- sometimes the wait is hours. The customers park their cars, take a claim ticket from the attendant and gladly walk up to the service center's lounge where there is free Starbuck's coffee, all kinds of beverages and snacks and even portable DVD players and headphones with a choice of movies. Often the folks chat about their adventures in their X5's or the pleasure they had picking up their cars in Spartanburg and driving back to Cincinnait. Some folks regale others about their European delivery pick up in Munich and the fun they had driving on the autobahn.

Sitting in the Acura waiting area didn't even come close -- and there was no waiting room at the Infiniti dealer.

Somehow, the Germans seemed to have cracked the marketing code to imbue their cars, dealerships and, most importantly, their customers with passion -- soul -- for their fantastic creations.

The next day you can take the ski-lift up (and in July the view will be spectacular) where the 1936 winter Olympics were held. Then you can take another even more breathtaking cable car ride up the Zugspitze where you can have lunch and walk from Germany to Austria as the border cuts through the mountain. If you have time -- and I would urge you to make time -- you can drive your new BMW to Füssen and visit Neuschwanstein Castle.

After that day you can either drive back to Garmisch or motor on into Innsbruck, Austria or back to Munich.

If you want some restaurant recommendations in Munich, let me know.

Have fun -- that's another thing Germans know how to do so well."

1652,"March 1, 2015 7:43AM",benjaminh,"The 2016 Acura ILX has a new engine and transmission, as well as several other improvements. Previously it wasn't very competitive at the entry level, but now I think it is. The most direct competitor is the 2015 Audi A3 1.8. Both are good cars, but here are few comparison points....

2016 ILX base
$27,900 msrp
0-60: 6.2 (according to C & D)
hp 201
trunk: 12.3
8 speed DSG
29 mpg comb

2015 Audi A3 1.8
$29,900 msrp
0-60: 6.5 (C & D)
hp 170
trunk 10
6 speed DSG
27 mpg

Each one has advantages and disadvantages when it comes to standard equipment. The A3 has standard leather, standard XM in a better standard stereo, and split folding rear seats, none of which comes standard on the ILX.

But the ILX has standard the following things that I think are lacking on the base A3: moonroof, heated seats, LED headlights, rearview camera, smart entry/putshbutton start, USB port, 2 years longer power train warranty, Siri Eyes Free, etc.

Obviously somewhat difficult to compare, but I'd say that the ILX standard things are ""worth"" substantially more to me than the standards on the A3.

If you add a moonroof, pushbutton start, heated seats, back up camera, etc. to the A3 then the price seems to inflate to c. $36k or so. But the Acura model that would compete with that would be the ILX premium which is c. $30k msrp. That is a significant price difference.

The Audi has a lot more prestige than the Acura, but the ILX is likely to be more reliable and have a lower cost of ownership than the A3.

Yes, the ILX is based on the Civic, but then the A3 is based on the Golf, and so I don't see much of a difference there.

Both are good cars, but I do think that Acura is back in the game with the 2016 ILX."
1653,"March 1, 2015 8:59AM",ab348,"Well, time will tell. The outgoing model consistently lost every comparison test to the Buick Verano, much less the A3. Once the usual car magazine introductory hype dies down it will be a better time to assess."
1654,"March 1, 2015 10:06AM",markcincinnati,"Few A3's (at least in our climate in SW Ohio) will not be quattros. Also, I would think there won't be that much cross shopping of these two cars -- and I admit there is a good chance I am wrong.

There is something special about German cars -- eloquently described elsewhere by both the pro-writers and us amateurs -- that makes me think most ""Audi"" shoppers will first cross shop the other Germans, then perhaps another European brand, then, maybe, a Japanese brand.

I asked the Audi dealer who (the brand) they compete with. The answers depended on the car, of course, but the A3 and ILX were never mentioned in the same sentence. Now, granted, this is a data point; and this is perhaps indicative only of Cincinnati shopper's habits. The names (brands) brought up included BMW (doh!), Mercedes and Porsche -- the Macan vs the Q5/SQ5 for instance.

Acura's today inhabit that unenviable position where Audi used to live: Acuras are Hondas when spoken of; Audis used to be Volkswagens as recently as 20 years ago. It wasn't until Audi moved farther and farther away from being a VW that knows somebody, that they were able to break into the Premium class. Acuras, so I thought, had made some pretty good inroads into no longer being ""fancy"" Hondas -- remember the RLX from the not too distant past? Now, they've slipped -- and for all I know the slippage is deliberate -- and gotten closer to their Honda roots. Simultaneously, Honda has kept moving forward and upward at a pace that Acura has apparently not been willing or able to keep pace with.

Don't get me wrong, I can't pinpoint something with respect to my 2012 TL SH-AWD Advance that I can blast other than its ugly beak. Yet, just the reaction to the car itself was underwhelming. No one ever seemed to have any curiosity about my TL. The day I drove my new S4 into the office, however, folks were all over the thing, asking questions and showering it with praise.

The point is folks here in Cincinnati at least will fawn over a BMW, Mercedes, Porsche or Audi and will hardly give an Acura or Infiniti the time of day. The Lexus IS 350 F sport, however, will attract car buffs and elicit questions -- as will a Cadillac ATS.

Maybe it's just that Cincinnati is a German town -- sister city to Munich, after all -- but at this point in time, Acura's just can't get no respect. I think were I somehow in a Bizarro world shopping for an ILX, I'd probably run, not walk, to the nearest VW dealer and look at a new VW CC R-line instead."
1655,"March 1, 2015 11:06AM",benjaminh,"markcincinnati: You make some good points. But for those who don't need the prestige of the German makes, or to have their cars talked about, Acura might be a choice again now. Maybe a small part of the lack of buzz for Acuras in your area is that they are actually made right in Ohio lol? Once the Acura NSX is launched later this year, might it inject a small amount of buzz into the brand?"
1656,"March 1, 2015 3:01PM",markcincinnati,Of that I am certain.
1657,"March 2, 2015 6:50AM",graphicguy,"I don't know that I'd go so far as to say there's something special about German cars. I think after you own cars for awhile, and you've owned lots of brands/models, you see the differences in materials, engineering, build to be differentm, but not necessaily better, from one marque to the next.

Granted, BMW and Mercedes seem to do things differently than say Acura, or Infiniti (and certainly different than Cadillac). For example, try using the shifter in the BMW 5 Series or the column dhifter in most Mercedes. You kind of go....""who thoguht that was a good idea?"".

Audis better in that regard. But still, there seems to be a level of complexity in the German makers that isn't really necessary. Never owned a Mercedes, but in my Audi and BMWs, I attribute that to why maintenance and repairs are so high compared to an ATS, or CTS, or TL, etc. Does it make a BMW, Audi or Mercedes better? I've yet to see any evidence of that.

All that said, I do understand the appeal of BMW. I liked the ones I had, quite a bit. The dealerships are top notch. Their cars, while moving away from what I want in an ELLPS, are still top dogs in the category.

Lots of competition in the space, though. Plenty for everyone to choose from. And, they're all good entries in the space."
1658,"March 2, 2015 8:43AM",roadburner,"Enthusiasts used to buy BMWs because they were great cars. Now many new buyers select a BMWs so that they appear to be an enthusiast- like the clown I met at my dealer's F30 intro; he informed me that ""I like automatics- I want to get in the car and not have to do anything.""
(And I'm not slamming automatics- I'm slamming that pathetic reason for owning one)

I'm seeing more and more friends in the CCA(many of whom are long-time members) moving to 911s, Caymans, and CTS-Vs or V Sports- not to mention Boss 302s or Z06s."
1659,"March 2, 2015 10:35AM",markcincinnati,"While I do love a debate even a non-mean-spirited argument, I perhaps should perhaps attempt to clarify at least some of my previous comments in response to: "". . . for those who don't need the prestige of the German makes, or to have their cars talked about . . . .""

I am certain there are indeed car buyers who buy a brand for ""prestige."" There are perhaps business people who believe they must wear Armani suits, Prada shoes and sport Rolex watches on their wrists, and drive ""appropriate to their station"" autos for at least the reason that their clientele expect it of them. We may have become more shallow as a group of people overall (those of us in much of the world, not just the US); that is a debate for another place and time. The thing is, the folks [executives, C-level folks and VPs on up the chain] who hire corporate lawyers, CPAs, brokers, investment bankers, architects, interior designers, consultants and so forth would probably have different perceptions of the professional they were about to engage or the senior manager they were about to hire based on some of the candidates accoutrements.

Perception is reality so the saying goes.

You may be correct that a top o' the line KIA or Equus is virtually every bit as competent and luxurious as an S class, 7 series or A8L, but the market perception isn't there yet.

The point is not that someone may buy the car for the prestige -- although they may -- the point is that some force (""may the force be with you"") has imbued your Rolex watch with certain ""characteristics"" that set it apart from my beautiful, equally functional and competent-as-a-timepiece Tissot.

Given a choice, better yet, we've [all] learned that given a choice of being gifted with a new Impala LTZ or a somewhat like-sized BMW 5 series, we ""should"" pick the BMW. In the same vein, given a choice of an Acura RLX or a Mercedes E class, well, the Mercedes will be chosen over and over.

These assignments of prestige were earned somehow (weren't they?)-- is it possible it is because the E class or BMW or whatever has earned a reputation for inherent goodness and/or desirability and value that the RLX just can't compete with?

I don't know why an individual thinks they ""need or don't need"" prestige in their attire, car they drive, club they belong to or college they attend. I don't even care, really. What I am on about is how the thing -- that objet d'art -- perhaps got to be that way.

BMW's for example, may -- today -- no longer be the performance machines worshiped by some from an historical perspective. Perhaps BMW and the other [snooty?] Germans [and the people who buy them?] are simply resting on their laurels. Perhaps they are the naked emperors now. I wouldn't bet against them quite yet, however.

Perhaps Acura, Infiniti and Lexus (soon to be displaced by KIA, don't you know) will be dubbed the new Premium players by the cognoscenti of cars at Automobile, Car & Driver, Motor Trend, Road & Track and yes, even Consumer Reports. Look at the new CR magazine (best and worst car issue) and see where the Audi A6 comes in, just for the fun of it.

Most of us don't need our cars to be talked about. None of us wants our cars to be talked about as a negative reflection of us, however. But, we certainly don't mind if our cars (and the other stuff I mentioned above) paints us in a light that is positive. The real estate sales person who takes you around looking at houses in her new Q7 or Escalade may -- for good reason, who knows? -- make you feel like a winner compared to the sales person who drives you around in his obviously not new Chrysler 300. The lawyer who -- well you get the picture -- gives you confidence is probably the one who appears by some societal/cultural measure to be successful.

People need what they perceive they need -- and part of that perception of a given product comes from something the product has done to earn a certain reputation (prestige, some measure of prestige or lack of prestige altogether).

Cars are where they are due to many factors -- Acuras, not to pick on them, do not ""suggest"" the same thing as BMW's, for instance. You may or may not call that prestige, performance, price or even presence. Today, it is very, very likely that given a choice of a new Acura or BMW, ""most people"" will choose BMW.

The names Acura, Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Porsche, Cadillac, Lexus, Toyota, etc, etc, etc could have been used as substitutes in some of the preceding. It is not my intention to savage Acura or inordinately praise BMWs. Personally I am an Audi fan of the highest order. Between my wife and myself, we have owned American, German and Japanese cars since 1969 (mostly German, full disclosure). My experience with Acrua was, overall, positive -- and my TL was, in my estimation, Acura's somewhat successful imitation (bargain) Audi S4. I have no axe to grind with Acura, that is.

However, therefore, notwithstanding: I do notice that I am accorded certain societal, er ""perks"" when I wear my Breitling watch vs my Swiss Army and when I wear a certain designer sport coat vs Jos A Banks and when I arrive in an Audi vs an Acura or Infiniti. It's also better to be sporting a Mont Blanc pen instead of a Cross. It's better to be using an iPad than an Acer, And, it is better to order Ornellaia than E. & J. Gallo.

It just seems that we have arrived at a point in time where the Germans -- for whatever reason -- rule. Cadillac is on the rise, Acura is on the wane and both Infiniti and Lexus need to further rationalize their offerings, although Lexus seems to be doing just fine, thank you very much.

Just remember, good is the enemy of great.

Acura makes good cars.

More's the pity."
1660,"March 2, 2015 12:08PM",markcincinnati,"I'm not sure folks buy BMW's so they can appear to be an enthusiast -- I'm pretty certain a lot of BMW shoppers (and ultimately buyers) aren't really all that aware, even, of BMW's reputation in that regard.

I would suggest that for some BMW's have the reputation as being ""the best"" -- so someone lusts for a BMW for a few years and then when that first ""big jump"" in comp or first ""big hit"" in an investment banking transaction that they were part of gives them that high five figure or six figure bonus comes along, well they go for ""the best"" which they think is a BMW.

My suspicion is that someone buys (or leases) a Porsche because it will make them appear to be an enthusiast, or, perhaps even more likely, they really ARE an enthusiast.

Or, and I hope this isn't really the case, someone buys that RS7 or 911 to suggest a certain size attribute of a body part. Or, the car is acquired simply to demonstrate the size of your check-book balance.

I read an article about people who seek speeding tickets so they can brag -- obtusely -- about their income, as in ""I can afford that [speeding ticket]."" That's inane -- maybe even insane.

Yesterday we were out and about in snowy Cincinnati -- only 4-wheel drive vehicles seemed to be venturing out -- I saw an A8L and my comment was, ""I don't care how much money we have, how big the bonus is, etc, don't ever get an A8 for me."" Sure the car suggests something about the owner's income -- but were I to think about spending inordinate sums of money to haul my skinny (or fat, as the case may be) butt around (mostly with no one else in the car with me), my choice would be an S6 -- pretty much the ultimate sleeper car if you axe me. Probably only a very few would even know of its somewhat lofty price tag, as a matter of fact. But that's just me. My friend buys A8's and never has any passengers in them -- I am so tempted to inquire if he has more money than sense. I just keep my mouth shut.

The folks I [superficially] socialize with at either the BMW Store or the Audi Connection here in River City, actually seem to be very much into Audis and BMWs and cars in general. They know, sometimes, as much as the sales personnel, about all of the cars ""in the BMW or Audi family.""

My wife and I attended a 2-day driving school in Spartanburg SC with a group of folks from all over the US and most of them owned both BMWs and non-BMWs and were very much car aficionados of the highest order.

I'm thinking folks buy these cars because the cars have earned the reputations as being the best -- some folks may think that means the best performing, some may think most luxurious. I've never met anyone who bought one to ""look like they were a 'brand-name-here' enthusiast"" though.

But, I could be wrong."
1661,"March 2, 2015 12:35PM",roadburner,"It's painfully obvious that you'd encounter enthusiasts at a driving event. You aren't going to meet the dweebs who talk about the ""powerful V6"" in their ""Beamer"" at the Performance Center or at a CCA HPDE."

MB, however, has lost me with their, to me, ""mean"" looking styling of late. But looking at the reviews of the local Audi dealer just now I came across this:

""Currently have my Audi A4 in for repairs. It has 57,000 miles on it, and I will be walking out with a $5000+ repair bill. This is on top of $1500+ I spent on repairs in the last 7 months....""

Yikes! Acura stirs my emotions too, and part of that is the desire for reliability, durability, and low cost of ownership. If I want drama in my life I'll watch television or a movie. I don't need my car to give it to me lol!"
1663,"March 2, 2015 2:46PM",markcincinnati,"roadburner: You are, of course, correct -- for the most part those who attend driving events are enthusiasts and often well informed ones at that.

Earlier I had perhaps inartfully attempted to say that I noted the folks (customers) at BMW dealers did behave enthusiastically about BMWs and often cars in general and that I could not say the same was true at an Acura dealer (for instance). Even those ""dweebs"" who may incorrectly talk (gush perhaps?) about their BMW's V6 engines do continue somewhat to make the point -- the ""tone and tenor"" of the shoppers and buyers of BMWs and Audis is -- even when factually incorrect -- very much upbeat, excited and passionate.

The only thing I have ever seen, however, that even approaches the dweeby-ness you suggest is when someone at the Audi store asks me if my S4 (with the V6 T badge on it) has noticeable turbo-lag or some remark indicating they are unaware that Audis V6s are super, not turbo charged. I correct them, of course and they then ask me why Audi puts the ""T"" on both the super and turbo charged cars.

I give them the party line that is somewhat difficult to say with a straight face, we both shrug and I then tell them my S4 is both incredibly quick off the line and very fast thanks to the instantaneous response only a supercharged (or, granted, a naturally aspirated) engine can offer.

Even the dweebs are excited at the Audi and BMW store is the point -- the folks [shoppers] at Infiniti of Cincinnati and Columbia Acura, well, they're more concerned with things like ""can I run it on regular?""

Maybe I need to seek out a better class of dweebs."
1664,"March 2, 2015 3:16PM",benjaminh,"markcincinnati: Your thoughts on the different cultures surrounding each make seem to me to be perceptive, funny, and mostly on target. Acura does have its own subculture of nerds and devotees, I think, but they tend to be more subdued and, as you suggest, more ""practical."" Acura is in the midst of a renaissance, I believe, as their products are now more performance-oriented and more innovative. Its seems doubtful that they'll ever catch up to the enthusiasm and popularity of the top makes, but I think there's a chance they could get closer. Just like for every other make, there are fan sites for Acura too, and some of the people there seem quite knowledgeable:

http://acurazine.com/

Even though Leonard Nimoy famously participated in an advertisement for Audi along with Zachary Quinto, which I imagine everyone here knows, in my mind Acura is the more ""logical and rational"" luxury brand. Perhaps for some Acura lacks passion at times, but as a long time Star Trek fan I somehow imagine that Mr. Spock might approve of some of their cars, as well as of their legendary reliability and longevity. And for passionate design I think there are few supercars more exciting at the moment than the new Acura NSX:

http://www.acura.com/FutureVehiclesNSX.aspx"
1665,"March 2, 2015 4:20PM",markcincinnati,"It amazes me how quickly KIA (and specifically the Genesis ""brand"" on the other side of the house) has (or is it have?) started to make the case that they, someday, may give the current Premium Class members a rude awakening. As you might imagine, being an Audi loudmouth for so many years, I do participate in my share of (apparently) Audi sponsored surveys.

I was surprised to see the number of questions some of these surveys contain that clearly indicate the Germans (or maybe it is just Audi, I dunno) are concerned that some Korean mfgrs are ""breathing down their necks.""

Now, I said that last bit for emphasis, but there has been at least a seed planted in the German mfgrs minds that says, ""The Koreans are Coming, The Koreans are Coming"" (and of course I immediately add -- mentally -- ""Cover yourself with butter and carry lemons just in case. . .!"")

But seriously, I saw some TV show on Velocity (I think) where a new Genesis (V8) was compared to a Mercedes E-Class and a Volvo S60. Now, at the time, before the video rolled, I thought, ""Whose dumbass idea was it to compare these three; they're not even close, no one would ever cross shop them?!""

Turns out I was wrong -- the Genesis, although not exactly a great handling car, has had its suspension tuned by Lotus (sorta) and the thing had a very powerful and smooooooth V8 hooked up to an 8-speed transmission (plus it had all of the latest and greatest electronic safety aids and toys the Germans keep loading their cars with.) Considering that this 2nd gen Genesis was in its first model year, I had to marvel at how far they've come and how fast they've done it.

I did think, too, Lexus was literally a trim-piece brand (and where are they now? First Place? or at least close to it) -- there weren't even any Lexi in Japan, they were all just called Toyotas. Now, look at Lexus -- a legitimate force to be reckoned with even if generally speaking some (OK most, OK, all) enthusiasts never have taken to them or seen them as anything more than sofas on wheels. Few, even the haters, laugh at Lexus now. And they actually brought that spunky little dude, the IS 350 F Sport to market and pantsed a BMW 335 (look it up, if you don't believe me.)

It would be hard to argue that both the top of the line Genesis, Equus and KIA cars aren't making ""don't look back, those headlights gaining on you are Korean"" type sounds.

So why isn't it possible for Acura to, likewise, kick butt and -- eventually -- regain some of its premium-ness? Of course, I don't KNOW, know, but I think, it is because they have found a niche where they have been and are successful, they make reliable and durable cars, their cars are in some pretty cool Marvel movies and the halo car has sex appeal. Have a cigar (and by the way, which one's Pink?)

By the way, I do think the NSX will be a great ambassador for the Acura brand, I just am not sure I see someone rushing in and buying an RLX based on the fact that the NSX wears an Acura badge. The gap between the NSX and the TLX or even RLX is unlikely to be narrowed by an oooober expensive sports car -- if you axe me.

Mean time, Genesis and KIA cars are quietly gaining ground and buzzing around the Premium Club members -- and you know what? Pretty soon one of them will sneak its way in and, then, well, there goes the neighborhood.

Human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together... mass hysteria!

What next? Chrysler resurrects the Imperial?

We're headed for a disaster of biblical proportions.

1666,"March 2, 2015 4:31PM",graphicguy,"My track days are over. But, I still like a good handling car. I'm not nearly as critical between FWD/RWD/AWD as the current enthusiasts are. There was a time it made a difference (like running at mid-Ohio years ago). Just not so much any more.

These suspensions have become quite sophisticated. I do like the trick torque sensing rears of the Caddy, Audi, Acura. They truly allow rotation around any corner that really defies description.

I also like the current trend of tubo/supercharging smaller motors to get more power out of less displacement. I had a Saab turbo in the '80s. That one was ""hit the gas....wait for it....wait for it....BAM....steering wheel jerked out of my hand if I wan't holding on, and in the weeds you could go. Fun.....for about a week."

As for the Koreans usurping the German throne, I'd think that won't be a possibility for some time. Having said that, I recall a column I wrote several years ago where I noted that the Optima Turbo was a very nice car- and while it definitely was not a sports sedan, neither was an F10 528i.

I also draw a distinction between ""enthusiasts"" and those who are merely ""enthusiastic.""
The enthusiastic owner is like the person who gets behind a basketball team once they go deep in the NCAA Tournament- but is unable to name any of the starting five, never mind what position they play. There automotive counterparts are the owners with V6 Beamers; they think a port installed LSD is an intravenous hallucinogen and absolutely adore the electronic oil level sensor- that way they don't have to remember how to open the hood..
In contrast, an enthusiast at the very least knows the engine configuration of his/her car as well as which wheels are driven- and hopefully understands a few rudimentary handling terms.

Sad to say, I have noticed that several more ""mundane"" marques are attracting an increasing number of true enthusiasts- if not rabid gearheads. BMW seems intent on casting a larger net while using ""bait"" that is becoming more and more bland."

There seems to be this rush by BMW, Infiniti (with the Q), Mercedes to move closer to the middle, or to cast a bigger net, as you aptly put it. Audi has stayed pretty true to the luxury sports sedan mantra. And, a brand like Cadillac seems intent on taking care of the space that was vacated. In all frankness, I probably would have gone back to BMW after all the foibles with my S4. But, they transitioned into the F3x by then, and the drive to me was much less engaging with them. Plus, to get what I wanted, the prices really have sky rocketed on them to approx a $7K-$8K delta between my 335ix coupe and the just released 435ix equipped about the same way. Thanks but no thanks.

I really have become smitten with the ride/handling engineering of the ATS/CTS. The Mag Ride Control is the real deal. Never thought I'd say soemthing the size of my CTS as ""flingable"", but it is. It's just one of those cars that I look forward to driving every day....even love the looks of it....the quality of it...the build of it.

Still, I would like to get some seat time in the new Mustang GT or the Challenger with the Scat Pack. Not sure when, or even if I'd buy either. But can't say never. Never is a long, long time. It would be a 2nd (3rd?) car if I did."
1671,"March 3, 2015 12:03PM",markcincinnati,"Recently one (or more) of the ""big"" auto magazines (I think it was C&D) tested an old vs a new BMW. I assume the genesis of such a test was the ever growing brouhaha -- ostensibly from the faithful -- claiming the newer BMW's have lost some of their BMW-ness as BMW goes on the ""soich for more money!""

It seems, if memory serves, that the test reports demonstrated that the new BMW could better the old one in every significant (measurable) performance number.

Once again, since I am not, at this instant, in possession of the test report article, I could be mistaken. What I think I recall, however, is that despite the cries that BMW has forsaken the true believers, the numbers say otherwise.

I had been a die-hard manual transmission guy. Our Audis -- with the exception of my brand new 1997 A8 -- had always been manuals. My maxed out allroad (2003) had to be special ordered -- not that I probably wouldn't have anyway -- since the dealer simply did not stock stick shifts even back then. I couldn't believe Audi would simply no longer offer its cars with sticks (for the most part). The 2001 or 2002 A6 2.7T could be had with a stick but the same model with a 4.2 V8 was only offered with an automatic.

My wife's 2005 X3 had to be ordered, too, since there were virtually no X3's on the dealer's lot so equipped. As I recall we couldn't even test drive a stick BMW period.

When I got my 2005 A6, I knew I had probably enjoyed my last stick (the 2003 allroad 2.7T.)

Going on the hunt, I found that BMW did offer at least some stick shifts but there was little chance of finding one unless it was special ordered.

I now have a 7-speed DSG in my '14 S4. I, for the first time since 2003, don't miss the stick anymore.

Most people -- that I know, excluding my wife -- don't even know how to drive a stick, so I don't see much value in complaining about that, and, besides, the DSG is so much better at shifting than I ever was and the shifts don't feel like they're robbing power from the engine.

What we have today, if you believe Car & Driver (which I usually do), are better performing cars that have their performance characteristics available when you want them but invisible (for the most part) when you don't.

Yes, even Consumer Reports notes that an Audi [A6] is able to be sporty -- which I assume is somewhat of a statement that other brands (that they list) are not sporty.

I'm buying that today's fill in the blank (Audi, BMW, Mercedes & Porsche) automobiles are ""the best representations of sport sedans and CUV's ever on the market."" I'm, therefore, rejecting the notion that the old ones were better performers than the new ones. The fact that the brands have become more accessible to folks who don't think like I thought -- up until 2005 -- simply means the brands have the power to sustain themselves in the marketplace.

Even if I really thought a 10 or 12 year old M3 was somehow better than a new one, I am pleased that BMW has ""cast a wider net,"" for I fear had they not, they would be going or already have gone the way of the dodo.

The disdain so many have for sentimentality never ceases to amaze me -- my sentimental favorite car ever is my 1995 Audi S6 in pearl teal with a brilliant white leather interior. God I loved that car -- still have fond memories for it. It was, despite its being my favorite, no where near the car my 2014 S4 is -- the older S6 was, in perhaps every measurable way -- ""inferior"" to the new (or almost new) S4. My current S4 is the best car I have ever had, by a wide margin. I assume it would, in every measurable way, be crowned winna and champeen were it compared to the old S6 or even a last gen S4 (the one with the V8).

These cars that we talk about here and have strong opinions about are the best they have ever been (in every significant and measurable way). The fact that BMW or Audi now attracts folks who don't know that there isn't a V6 under the hood of their BMW is sad (for me at least); but, I would argue that the ignorant owner is just as desirable (as a customer) to BMW as the one who knows there is a turbo-charged inline-6 under the hood. In the end, car companies must put the soich for more money ahead of the soich for informed, appreciative and passionate customers. The way they go about selling more cars, however, is to build better cars that can be appreciated both by the true and pure disciples as well as the bourgeoisie.

Although I don't think the Koreans are TODAY too much of a threat to the world-order, I don't think we should dismiss them out of hand. They are making very rapid advances -- pretty soon they may find entry into the Premium Class (and by pretty soon I think we should be very watchful of the evolution of their products for the next 5 or so years.) I remember the first Toyotas that were imported (back in the 60's) -- made in Japan was, then, not much of a threat. It didn't take long until they were nibbling at US made market share, then they just started taking ever bigger bites until names like Toyota, Honda and Datsun were forces to be reckoned with.

I got into a new Genesis sedan -- it wasn't a Mercedes -- but honestly, I do think it was a very interesting attempt to convince ""you"" that it was worth a second look. Whenever the 3rd gen comes out, I would look for some serious suspension evolution which could go a long way toward making us take them more seriously."

It concludes:
the most significant change from the E90 to the F30 results from the switch to electric power-steering assist, which diminishes feel. Body roll in the two cars is identical, but the use of rear-suspension understeer instead of  larger tires in back may be why the new 328i feels less agile turning into corners. All of  it adds up to a softer, tamer 3-series that’s more about luxury than fun."
1673,"March 3, 2015 2:19PM",markcincinnati,"RB - No, The one I recall compared a new M3 to an old M3 (old being a relative term).

I do have a question - let's just say that the consensus of expert opinions favors the old over the new; what are consumers to do (assuming they want the car brand and model that has ""slipped"" during the transition from old to new)? If a 2009 BMW (or Mercedes, Porsche, etc) is superior to a 2015, many (perhaps most) consumers would still opt for the 2015 for reasons of reliability and durability (and factory warranty).

And, in the tests that I recall, the real performance differences between the old and the new are often only most noticeable above 8/10ths -- a place where few ever drive their daily drivers. So, even those who long for an E vs an F BMW or an Audi B7 vs a B8, etc, can't really go out and get a ""new"" E or B7; and, probably most of them want a 2015 not a 2008, 2009 or 2010.

I never had a V8 S4 -- and I'm told some were PO'd at Audi for changing to a super-charged V6. But I have nothing to compare my V6 T to in that regard, and hunting for a used S4 V8 is simply something I wouldn't even be interested in doing.

So the question is/stands: What can or will ""you"" (or the consumer) do? Seek out the ""better"" older version? Go to another brand? Take public transportation?

And, if newer models are actually better than the older versions and you just don't like the new ones, what will you do, boycott the company or fix and repair the old one until parts can no longer be found? Is moving to Cuba an option?"
1674,"March 3, 2015 2:49PM",nyccarguy,"I think a big part of what BMW has lost is that it has cast such a ""large net."" The current crop of 3 series cars just doesn't do it for me the way its predecessor did. 3 years ago I made a financially dumb move and traded in my 2010 Acura TSX for a leftover 2011 BMW 328xi. I drove the car once and figured out a way to make it work by leasing the 328xi for 2 1/2 years. Fast forward to today. If I still had my Acura (yes I'm a card carrying member of Chronic Car Buyers Anonymous) and said to myself just as I did 3 years ago: ""You know what, the incentives on this 320xi or 328xd are really strong, I've always wanted a 3er, so let me take a test drive...""

1676,"March 3, 2015 5:59PM",markcincinnati,"I would assume you were not the target buyer of the car you bought/leased.

I know the Audi brand better so hopefully this is a reasonable parallel:

The new Audi A3 -- even the S3 -- is not at all attractive to me. The new Q3, likewise, doesn't do it for either my wife or me. I'd bet even the eventual RS Q3 will not be attractive to us. Maybe it is the size of the A3, maybe it is that it seems a class lower in terms of the materials used throughout the interior. I would, therefore, assume if I were to acquire an A3, even the Prestige quattro version with the most potent turbo-4, I would be working hard to figure out how to ditch it at the first opportunity.

Come to think of it, it probably isn't the size of the A3 or Q3, it is just that it seems too much like it is an Audi-light vehicle (and I'm not speaking of it's curb weight.) The CLA Mercedes and the BMW 1 series, likewise just don't do it for me. My wife was loaned a 1 series (and it had the turbo i-6) BMW -- I drove it, very powerful, but it seemed, somehow, ""cheaper"" in the materials it was made out of. The Q3, which we had for a day and a half earlier this year, didn't have the cheapness issue I noted in the A3, but it was way, way underpowered -- it felt like a Tiguan (doh! it is a fancy Tiguan, after all).

All of our Audis have felt at least adequately powered, so the current Q3 seems like it was pulled out of the oven before it was done. Maybe I'll change that opinion once the regular Audi 2.0T engine is in place.

The $50,000 S3 was twitchy, like a go cart is twitchy, it was noisy at speed on interstate 275, where I drive every day in my quiet S4. The vast expanse of black plastic on the dash looked like something out of the rental fleet at Budget, not something that the sales person has to say with a straight face: ""we can sell this one for $47,900!""

So, you leased a left over BMW that was probably meant for a younger, earlier in their earnings arc, customer. You paid too little, got too little and were underwhelmed.

On the other end of the scale, you may have been equally unhappy with an Audi A8 -- or BMW 7 series. These cars are developed with input from design, engineering, marketing, production/manufacturing and of course, finance. When deciding what to do, I would imagine those in charge decide ""there is a target market for an X5, an X3 and now an X1."" There's also a market, a narrow market I would imagine, for the X6.

Those $70,$80 and $90,000+ 4-door German coupes from Audi and Mercedes are not marketed, I would assume, to a 23-year old with a freshly minted MBA from Ohio State or a 25-year old who just completed his/her JD from the University of Cincinnati College of Law.

Is the wider net a good thing to do? I probably would have said no a couple or three years ago, but maybe now, the market is such that these premium makers want to get them (the customers) early (aka ""young"") and make certain there are upmarket models ""within the family"" to aspire to.

My sales rep at the Audi Connection told me his wife wanted a new Audi Q3 -- he had to carefully market and sell his wife first AGAINST the Q3 and then move her thinking to the Q5 or Q7, stopping along the way at the A4 based allroad. Why? Well, the Q3 was ""not enough car"" for her as a Fortune 500 executive with three children aged from 12 to 15, a big dog (her husband) and a border collie. The Q3 would have been a fine choice about 14 years ago.

And this guy sells cars for a living -- no longer are car sales people ""order takers"" (if they ever were).

Hopefully you get my drift -- your expectations and your ""situation"" were not a good match for the leftover BMW you leased -- and it was a disservice to you to not shepherd you through the buying process. I think you weren't given what you needed to make an informed decision."

Sorry for the confusion in my post. I wanted to write a little more, but got called away from my desk while eating lunch (happens A LOT since my name's on the door). While the time I spent with the E90 328xi was brief, it was nothing short of amazing.

I had wanted a 3 series ever since I drove a friend's 1995 E36 328is 5MT through the streets of Buffalo late one night into early one morning. The car was just perfect. It fit me like a glove. At the time I didn't have too much stick shift seat time, but by the end of the night I was rotating the car car around corners.

I liked my Acura TSX that I inherited from my wife when we bought a Pilot to accommodate our upcoming 3rd child (she's 3 now), but didn't LOVE it. I saw an ad for leftover 2011 328xi BMWs, crunched some numbers, test drove the car, & fell in love. An inflated residual, $2000 in trunk money, 2 additional $500 payment credits, plus a $500 BMWCCA rebate gave me enough ammo to convince my wife that I want it & it makes sense (and cents).

My experience with the current crop of F30 3ers came when I brought my brilliantly balanced 328xi in for service. I drove a 328xi, a 320xi, & a 320xd. Nice cars. Very smooth riding. I'll even go as far as saying the 328 was MUCH faster than my inline 6's 230 horsepower. The chassis seemed to be stiffer. As an enthusiast, I just had little idea of what was going on. The car felt very disconnected.

Since BMW has moved into making their cars softer, they lost the edge they had over competitors like Lexus.

The scene at your BMW dealership on Saturday AMs is how things should be. Waxing poetically about their respective BMW. The truth is that inflated residuals, free maintenance, & low lease payments are what fuels the BMW brand."
1679,"March 3, 2015 9:10PM",roadburner,"As to your first question, I will either seek out an older version or go to another brand; I like the M235i but I balk at paying around $3000 to get a true mechanical limited slip in a car that already costs north of $40,000- especially when such an ""exotic"" technology is either optional or standard on the GTI, Miata, not to mention every V8 ponycar. The vanilla F10 and F30 leave me cold, regardless of their horsepower, and my opinion is shared by much of the US enthusiast press(remember when Automobile and Car and Driver were constantly accused of being biased towards BMWs? When is the last time a non-M model won a comparison test?). Now you are absolutely right; the wearers don't care, and Munich apparently no longer does either.
Fortunately BMW M is still cranking out decent cars. I think the new M3/4 is a return to form; I liked the E9x V8 but it drove like the true successor to my bitterly missed E24 M6- more a fast GT than a true sports car like the E46 M3. Ditto for the M5; the E60 V10 iteration was just a mess- the new car feels like it has a little E39 DNA spliced in.
I have no problem maintaining my 2 older BMWs- one thing BMW still does right is provide for older models; thanks to BMW Classic I can get virtually any part I need for my 1975 and 1995 BMWs at my dealer's parts counter. If it isn't in stock I rarely have to wait more than 2-3 days. And when I bring my 1995 Club Sport in for service I still get a loaner."

1682,"March 3, 2015 11:25PM",flightnurse,"I'm gone for 2 days and this forum lights up...

First I laugh at people who criticize cars and brand after a short drive. Second, I pity the fool (in my best Mr. T voice) for criticizing cars without really driving longer then 1,2 or 8 days.

Lets look at the Geneses, Rick's Geneses has 65K miles on it, has only been in the shop for routine service. So basically flawless so far. So some of you say that people buy BMW's, MB's and Audi's because they want to prove something.. The Geneses is a very nice E class, for 2/3 the cost of a E class. I don't think anyone would say that the E class is a true sport sedan, and I wouldn't say the Geneses is one too, but after owning one for 3 yrs, I can say with fact that the Geneses is just as good as a MB E class or a BMW 528i (non line car.) Base price for those car's are 50K, a fully loaded Geneses can he had slight under 50K. The """"jittery"" suspension of the first Gen Geneses isn't a major issue, it's not a sport sedan and again it was never marketed as one. But if you were looking for a e class car, and price gave you a nose bleed, the Geneses was a great alternative.

Again on the comments about F3x, it's great people write reviews on these cars with limited real seat time, this doesn't make them ""experts."" Having 25K miles on mine, I have to say, this car has exceeded my expectation. This is why I'm looking at the F33 4 series Grand Coupe, I wish BMW would import the 435d, this would blend power and efficiency to a whole new level. But I'll take the 435i, however, when I'm ready to order my car it will be the 440i. Are the new F3x cars softer then the E series, yes, the ""true"" enthusiast can not keep BMW and Porsche in business so they had to do something to get a larger pool of people. I mean, for the people who buy the CPO cars, how does this keep the manufactures open? They don't, they keep the dealers open, it's the people who purchase new cars are the one who keep the manufactures open. I had always said, the E39 5 series was the perfect size car, and the F30 is slightly smaller then the E39. So BMW has been working on the EPS (elec power steering) to get the feel back, this would shut up some people. I just got back from a trip, slightly over 400 miles, I averaged 36 mpg, no one complained about cramp rear seats, and the ""numb"" steering wasn't an issue in which I couldn't control the car going up and down the mountain roads of southern AZ.

This is why Rick is getting a F34 328i GT, the car still has a very German ride to it, much more then his Geneses, the rear seats have more room then his Geneses and or a 5 series. Not everybody want a ride that is so stiff that there is a risk of losing their fillings. Since all GT's are xDrive, we are getting the Dynamic Handling Package this allows to have greater control in the x Drive cars when either the Sportline or M Sport lines are ordered (Rick is getting a Sportline GT.)"

Actually, I may end up with another TLX sometime, but probably for my wife. Aside from the fact that I do believe they offer great value in the ELLPS space, they just don't break. And, they don't cost an arm and a leg to maintain. I do like the looks of the new TLX, but I also liked the previous version, too.

Driving my wife's Accord, and driving (albeit breifly) a new TLX, I can tell the differences immediately between the two. Most of it is underneath, though. SH AWD and some obvious thought given to the suspension in the TLX and sound deadening, it's a different and better drive in the TLX.

Not everyone will see it that way, though. They'll look a the dual screens on the dash and the motor similarities between the Accord and the TLX and declare the Accord to be the better value.

Accords are nice, sporty, mainstream cars that are cheap to own and fix. The Acura is all those things too. But, it handles better, rides better, steers better, has better materials inside and out. And, if you want, a torque vectoring rear in their SH AWD version. Can't get those things in an Accord.

Playing devil's advocate for a moment, a neighbor bouight an Accord Hybrid a few weeks ago. LOVES IT. Drives and handles like a regular Accord while getting 40 MPG. Impressive.

It's shrewd but cynical marketing on Munich's part, forcing enthusiasts to pay considerably more to get a car with traditional BMW driving characteristics. Even European drivers are unsure of which end their 1er is driven, so I suppose BMW figures why bother offering a better driving experience.

Another problem is that the competition has become much more intense as the playing field has leveled. It used to be that great handling, supportive seats, decent brakes, and an engaging powertrain were the exclusive province of the Europeans, but not any more.

For example, If I wanted an AWD performance car a BMW wouldn't be on my radar- a Golf R would be my likely choice, at least until the Focus RS arrives or Mazda offers their rumored AWD 300 hp MS3. While the M235i would be my choice if I wanted a great two door coupe, It's hard to ignore the S5, Mustang GT or 370Z NISMO which bracket the 2er at both ends of its price range.

Sure, she wants good gas mileage and a reliable and durable car -- all wrapped up in a vehicle that meets her definition of ""soul."" Her SQ5 (and, truth be told, probably a Porsche Macan) dots all the ""i's"" etc. Her Infiniti FX35 -- a car that I thought was very capable, even though it lacked a 354HP supercharged engine -- was very well built, was reliable for nearly 60,000 miles (so I can't speak to its durability) and despite its thrashy engine note, was pretty much fun to drive (if you could stand 16MPGs). Yet, her Infiniti and my Acura TL pretty much made her run, not walk to the Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Mercedes, Porsche, Volvo and VW dealers to find a CUV -- a high performance CUV. The 300HP X3 was good, the Volvo XC60 Type-R was good, too, the Mercedes M class, VW Toureg and Cadillac SRX all had merit. We even tried the top o' the line Jeep Grand both with and without the Hemi. The MDX and RDX were also tested and quickly rejected.

When we got to the 3,0T Audi Q5 there was a glimmer of hope -- and there we were torn between the Q5 and X3 -- until we test drove the SQ5. I've never seen $21,000 (the down payment on the $65K MSRP) exit the checking account more quickly -- I think the second test drive of the SQ5 sealed the deal.

Yet, some here have spouses (or significant others) who are all about gas mileage or roominess for kids, dogs -- and all the stuff that goes along with kids and dogs.

And, the good news is, we're all right -- the SQ5 is the best car, just as the MDX or the TLX or the 535 or the ATS or A4 quattro or even the lowly Accord -- all of these vehicles are the best for ""your"" circumstances and situations.

When we get to the ELLPS and LPS class of cars, we are well beyond the basics -- we're into vehicles that are helping us in their own ways to self-actualize. That is what it is about -- finding the car that today will help you self-actualize. I'd add, if your spending on a new car doesn't help you even in some tiny way to self-actualize, you've NOT chosen wisely.

One of the car magazines (Automobile perhaps, hell, I dunno, I subscribe to all of them for pity's sake), has a phrase they use ""No Boring Cars."" I think as we enter one of the later decades of life, we do actually start to believe ""now is the time to eschew 'boring' cars"" (and other things, but this is the place for cars, NOT for other things); we decide we can differentiate between an Impala and a CTS, we can appreciate a Panamera (even if we decide not to spend that much on a car).

I've really enjoyed reading all the posts here (well mostly), for example the ones about the upcoming trip to Germany to pick up the new BMW, the good the bad and the ugly S4 issues, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat, so to speak.

I do enjoy the many perspectives y'all bring to the party here. I love it when this forum is active -- even when time doesn't permit my participation.

We are, if you axe me, in the golden age of cars -- almost limitless choice and hardly a klinker in the bunch.

I now have 23,000+ miles on my '14 S4 -- today I lust for an S6, tomorrow I'll instead hope for a new, slightly larger S4 to be unveiled. All the while, I am impressed every time I get behind the wheel of my current car. Reading your posts about your adventures in car shopping (and some mis-adventures) is great fun, often informative and from time to time frustrating.

Sorry to get so sentimental, but this forum is really a terrific outlet for those of us car enthusiasts whose appetite is larger than our bank accounts. It also has been, for me at least, a fantastic catharsis.

I think it is fantastic that you really enjoy your 320i. I don't think it is a bad car at all. I'm not disputing that it gets fantastic mileage or eats up hours of western US highways without a hint of driver fatigue. The car is comfortable and quiet. It is more spacious than the E90 I had. I just don't get that euphoric feeling inside that screams at me: ""find a way to get this car, NOW!"""

For 2016 BMW has ""supposed"" to have fixed the ""numbness"" in the steering, it wouldn't be like the E46 or E90 but better then what the F3x cars have currently. I drive the 320 the way BMW has intended it to be driven, as a daily driver, and the car does this well.

The only thing that she thought was a worthy competitor to the SQ5 was the Macan S (we didn't drive the Turbo -- and yes I know they're both turbocharged -- since it was way more money than we had planned to spend); yet similarly equipped the Porsche was some $10K more and it didn't even have pushbutton start and the design of the Macan made is have less utility.

Yes, the car actually goes where I want it to go (suspension seems to be responsive and compliant enough), but lack of the feedback is pretty significant for anybody who ever owned cars like Subaru WRX, or previous 3-series, especially like mine, with sport suspension. Every time after those couple of days, or a test-drive of other 3-series derivatives in the market, including 335 or 435 (those were with MSport lines), I'm glad I can get back behind the wheel of my 328 wagon. It's not as fast, or fuel efficient, may be even a bit noisier, but the steering feedback feel is far superior. Why BMW changed it? Two reasons - fuel and market demand. The second one came from their desire to sell more and more units. The more you want to sell, the more you have to appeal to average Joe, even if Joe has more than average income. Americans like things soft, I cru through tears every time I read those comments about ""such harsh"" suspension on sport package, they clearly never drove Audi, whose ""sport suspensions"" generally consist of stones in places of springs .

1712,"March 5, 2015 7:12AM",graphicguy,"BEing a staunch Acura and BMW lover, I was as shocked as anyone when I found the CTS to be more engaging to drive than either.

My 3rd gen TL was good, but a bit darty on the road. Fun to drive, though. The 4th gen TL (Acura Shield grill) added to the previous gen in big doses. It was more sophosticated, suspension was much better, it was faster, smoother....just all around better.

The current TLX I need more seat time in. But, it seemed to regress a bit over the previous version. Yes, it had all the tech....LED lights, shift buttons, 9 speed trans, quieter, plus it hit a price point with the 4 cyl that will appeal to many. But,, I came away thinking I enjoyed my 4th gen TL drive better.

I do think RB is right. There are driving enthusiasts who do know what their car can do and the specs of just about every important function of the car.

Then, there are those who just don't care. They just want a BMW or a Mercedes. They know what they're buying before they get behind the wheel of the test drive. They wouldn't know the difference between understeer or torque steer if you held a fire to their feet.

Not saying any of that is bad. Just think the majority of sales by the likes of the German brands have little to do with how engaging their cars are to drive. It has more to do with the perception of themselves by owning one of those brands.

Benjamin....the thing with a TLX, you'll not find a car with more tech in it on the road. It handles well (4 cyl and SH AWD versions). It's relatively quick. And, once you drive it off the dealer's lot, the only things you'll be back for is oil changes and tire rotations for most of its life. And if you do need something out of warranty fixed, you won't have to take a 2nd mortgage out. They get good MPG to boot. So, there's a lot to like.

TLONG....have you driven the new TLX yet? Might be worth it if you're actually starting to look. Although, I can't knock you for looking at something like the Mazdaspeed 3, however."
1713,"March 5, 2015 7:55AM",markcincinnati,"""We have met the enemy and he is us."" -- Pogo.

I agree with the following statement made here by one of our fellow posters:

""The more you want to sell, the more you have to appeal to average Joe, even if Joe has more than average income.""

What I sense here, however, is that ""average Joe"" is meant to imply someone who, due to their lack of sophistication, and due to their sheer numbers has been at least partially responsible for the degradation of the ""essence"" of BMW automobiles (at least the 3 series apparently) ride and handling characteristics. Somehow I get the feeling here that I (we) am (are) meant to hold ""average Joe"" accountable and to blame for the sorry state of current BMWs steering and ride/handling characteristics.

What BMW did was realize, apparently, that it is better to be popular with respect to your target market rather than attempt to appeal to what some have called the lunatic fringe. If you are the CEO, what is your charge? I would argue it is to first retain market share then to gain market share. If your loudmouth customers won't put their money where their mouths are, do whatever it takes to find the customers and prospective customers who will.

Why is it so difficult, virtually impossible, these days, to find manual transmission cars? If you read what I read, you would think manuals are the best way to go if you want the best performance possible. Were I an auto manufacturer's CEO, and I read these posts and virtually all of the automotive enthusiasts magazines, I would start making stick shifts available all across my car lines. I would spend time and treasure to make certain my brand would offer stick shifts and that my dealers would be required to keep stick models in stock.

My company would suffer, because as Pogo says, ""the enemy is us"" [sic]. All of us loudmouths who want stick shifts (based on our bellyaching) were all yak and no shak! Stick shifts aren't popular, they don't sell and if I listened to the lunatic fringe, my car company would die on the vine.

Stiff suspensions and steering that offers road feel don't increase sales, in fact they must actually decrease sales or they would dominate.

It is possible to order an Audi A6 with a sport suspension, ultra low profile tires and 20"" wheels -- and those tires would be max performance designation and be made of short tread life summer only compounds. You would think the benefits of the lower stiffer suspension calibration thicker anti-roll bars and the above mentioned tires and wheels would be so obvious that dealers couldn't keep A6's so built in stock.

The reality is, the very few sport suspension equipped models are the slowest sellers. Pogo strikes again.

I say we all need to go out and BUY the 3 series all tarted up with every performance enhancing option possible, ditto the Audi, Cadillac and Mercedes (and other brands) models.

We need to shut up, grow up and pay up -- the cars you're (me too) bitchin' about are the way they are because of YOU. If you had forced the issue and actually put your money where your mouth is, well we'd have great performing BMWs (and the others, too) instead of the cars so many of us decry as ""not what they used to be.""

The way they used to be is not responsive to the market.

Qwit yur bitchin'"
1714,"March 5, 2015 10:23AM",graphicguy,"Mark....bravo.

I have a little bit of a different view on a couple of points. Manual transmissions......frankly, I doubt there's anyone on this board that can shift faster than the current crop of autos. That's why we've been seeing performance numbers that are higher for autos than they are for automatics. Same goes for MPG (which isn't a ""nice to have""....gov't is making big MPG numbers a necuessity).

Personally, I'd rather have a 4 on the floor big block to carry me around. Efficient? Not hardly. Heavy and unwieldy? Yep...pretty much. But, that's what I'd like.

Point being, to gather market share, the BMWs, the Mecedes, the Infinitis, etc are all moving towards the middle. ""Let me have my 3-pointed star or my roundel, so I can get noticed. The rest? Performance? Handling? Who cares? That's not why I bought this car."" Those are the customers in this segment, now."
1715,"March 5, 2015 11:14AM",dino001,"I generally agree with you, Mark. I AM paying up (of course within limits of my abilities), I WILL NOT buy a car from a lot, just because it is a ""better deal"", if it doesn't hit my minimum requirements. There is no deal, if one gets not what they want. I also totally understand BMW's move. Calling me a part of ""lunatic fringe"" is a bit harsh - perhaps ""eccentric few"" would be more polite . Unfortunately, both average Joe Sixpack and Joseph Broker want a car ""today"". They can't fathom waiting for one a few weeks. So dealers and manufacturers run their business for those guys' pleasure, not mine. I already feel lucky, when I mention a special order, I get a quick nod from a salesman saying ""no problem, all we need is XYZ"", rather than more typical deer in headlights looks.

While I acknowledge BMW's right to do what they think is best for them, I also reserve myself a right to [non-permissible content removed] a little, if their choices differ from my preferences - just like with any other product we buy. There is no law saying we have to be ecstatic every time we buy something. Sometimes we buy a compromise - I venture to say most of the time. Ultimately, I know I have to adjust and get something closest to my ""ideal"" product. Doesn't mean I can't express in places like this, what I would like to see, or why I think that product is not available."
1716,"March 5, 2015 12:04PM",markcincinnati,"OMG -- I am not in any way, shape, manner, form or regard suggesting (for REAL) that we shouldn't express our opinions. For pity's sake, I was ranting -- sometimes I just get worn out reading posts about how things were better then than they are now.

Sure it is possible that a product (and a car is a product) from 2000 or 1996 or even 2012 is superior in some way or many ways to a 2015 model. Overall, it is my belief that as time passes the products generally improve either by being more effective or more efficient or both.

The thing is, somebody writes (while obviously wringing their hands) how they're so very very disappointed in the (speaking of automobiles) fill-in-the-blank's appearance, engine, transmission, seats, sound system, nav system, fuel economy, wheels, tires, brakes, headlights, tail-lights, side-lights, and on and on and on until I could just scream.

If, for instance, you don't care for the Audi A4 2.0T (insert trim level and options here) because it has a 4-cylinder engine and a tinny sounding audio system and flat, non-supportive seats, well I would counter with either: Don't buy one or Option the thing up the way you want it including getting an S (and in some cases RS) model. Audi and BMW (again, to name just two) provide customers with extensive optional (or ""available"") configurations.

""The 'old' 3-series was better?"" Better than what? I would argue you can option the 3-series to provide the looks (within reason), performance, handling, creature comforts, etc, that will allow you to have it your way.

Miss the i6 engine of yesteryear? Can't see yourself driving anything less than a vehicle with 6-cylinders? Get a 335. Better yet, get an M3 and stop being such a cry-baby. Me? I had to settle for an S4 with a 7-speed DSG transmission with a very nice B&O sound system and blind spot monitoring to say nothing of beautiful red leather seats. You'd think I'd gone daft were I to tell you my 1996 5-cylinder S6 was seriously a ""better"" car (even though it is a sentimental favorite).

Have to have a stick shift? -- well maybe you can maybe you can't get one in the particular fill-in-the-blank you want; but, as has been correctly noted above, today's dual clutch automatics and even torque converter equipped 8-speeds can and will out-shift Walter Röhrl on his best day -- do you think you can do better? (and besides the reason there are no stick shifts has already been explained and it is still YOUR fault).

The car you want in this era of virtual mass-customization probably does still exist. If you have to have analog steering with hydraulic assist, well, you'll probably have to buy a used car that may not have as many improvements as the 2015 or 2016 that you can buy off the lot, or better still order direct from BMW (or whoever).

Yes, yes, we should and hopefully will be permitted to continue, letting of steam: Wishin' and Hopin' for the good ol' days.

Gawd, some of us (and you know who you are) sound like my parents when I wanted to listen to the Beatles or Led Zep (or, heaven forbid, Pink Floyd): ""That's not music, its a bunch of barbarians, barbarians I tell you. Now Lawrence Welk, THAT's music Mark!""

If you (and you know who you are) just can't take the direction BMW is going, find something else and buy it. What I am concerned about (and often representative of) is our becoming a bunch of curmudgeons or maybe even Luddites.

Buying a 2005 fill-in-the-blank because that was the last year the arbitrary capillary was still used to keep the pressure evenly applied to the crank-knuckle, doesn't do anything for the advancement of the art and science of the automobile business (and we mustn't forget it is first and foremost a business).

All I am asking is that you (we) don't adopt my dad's approach to rock music in your descriptions of your disappointments with BMW or Audi or even Acura for abandoning us, the faithful -- dear old dad used to say this about rock music: ""Noise, Bohemian tripe, bang and twang over-loud, barbarians at the gates of hell!""

It gave me such great pleasure when I came home (from my first quarter of college) for Thanksgiving having gone without a haircut for nearly 5 months and blasting (I turned it up to 11):

I can, however shift my DSG with greater precision than I could ever shift a stick shift, and I was (and hopefully still might be) good at shifting.

But, it still doesn't matter -- ""no one"" buys them. I did test drive both an S4 6-speed manual and the DSG I ended up getting -- the DSG (shhh don't let this out) was better at it than I and, at high RPM's, the DSG never made a misstep and didn't require me to drive with one hand on the wheel.

I drank the Kool-aid apparently.

And, although I could have gotten my S4 with a stick, the S3, perhaps foreshadowing other coming attractions, can only be had with a 6-speed DSG.

Even my wife's 8-speed tiptronic has been programmed by folks so skilled, it seems like it MUST be a DSG, too.

I don't know about durability, but I imagine I might find out this time, since I plan to keep the thing beyond the factory warranty (but I have been thinking I would buy an extended warranty, cover myself with butter and carry lemons just in case.)

Yet, another argument that ""they're"" hoping ""we'll"" make is that we'll want to keep our vehicles as up to date as possible; and since most cars can't be updated to adopt the latest and greatest technologies, the notion of replacing cars about every 3-4 years does have some merit."

If I were to buy Acura again I would get the ILX as I've had the TL for 10 years and am tired of a car of this size - I want it a bit smaller. So no TLX, plus I'm not in the mood to spend that much. I certainly could afford it but just want to maximize my enjoyment and luxury for the $$.
-
I looked at the specs - I would pay probably $5K more for a ILX than a fully loaded Mazda 3 sedan. The Mazda has things like HUD, blind spot warning, even radar cruise control, all around $30K tops. It is a small bit larger than the ILX. It is widely praised as being like a baby BMW in handling. I know that in our '07 Mazda 5 which is of course a microvan, in pure maneuverability it outshines my current TL by quite a bit - tighter turning circle, better steering feel as an example. I would expect the current Mazda 3 to do quite a bit better than that.

The ILX on paper is a little smaller. Given my TL experienc, I'm sure it would be reliable and might be more refined than the Mazda, which is a consideration. The ILX has more HP but less torque, so not sure how they will both feel. And am still considering getting a manual if I could find either of them in that tranny, since they are both still offered with manual transmissions.

The other alternative is just hanging onto my '05 TL a few more years. It stays reliable at 150K, still looks good and drives well, I put a few $$ into it occasionally for battery/tires/brakes/fluids/etc. I did get the engine mounts and some suspension bushings changed at about 137K and spent about a grand.

Since the Acura ILX starts at 28k msrp, depending on the options you want you could have an ILX for less than a fully tricked out 3. In terms of size, the two are very close. In fact, the ILX and the 3 are within about an inch of each other in length and width.

The Mazda 3 with the 2.5 is rated by the epa at 32 mpg combined, which is a big jump from the 21 of your 2005 TL. But the ILX does pretty well at 29.

In terms of acceleration, at least according to Car and Driver, the ILX is about a second faster going to 60 than the Mazda3 2.5. ILX: 6.3 ; Mazda3 2.5: 7.3. To me it seems like a possible case for the ILX, but since I haven't driven either one I don't know about driving enjoyment.

1732,"March 6, 2015 2:06PM",markcincinnati,"Yes I am a Miami Alum, too and actually a Miami Merger -- got my undergrad and grad degrees from MU, worked at WOXR (not OXY) as the program director, commercial producer and had an on-air show 5 nights per week. We WERE for about 6 years the only prog rock station in SW Ohio. Those were the days. OXford Radio (OXR). I have no idea why the name was changed to OXY.

When I went to Miami, no cars were allowed unless you were married or until you were in grad school, so car commentaries weren't even on my radar. Actually did my Master's work (which used to be called a thesis, but by the time I was there it was called ""independent reading"" which was, so it seems, about 10x the amount of work as just taking a class would have been -- I mean I felt like I read the entire freaking library for pity's sake) on how mass-media (when there was no Internet) helped win World War II financially by getting people to buy the bonds that funded the thing. And, in 1976, your final act before getting your Master's was what was then called Master's Orals. As far as I know these days if you take and pass the courses you get the degree. Back then (1976, before you were born probably), you had to sit in front of three PhD's and the Dean and answer their questions and spar with them for about 90 minutes or so, so they could determine if you knew your subject matter. Probably helped that I was a DJ since talking was how I made my living (such as it was) at the time.

1738,"March 8, 2015 9:42AM",markcincinnati,"When I was new to trips to Germany, I would take every opportunity my wife would permit to go into Audi dealerships. I did the same thing on one trip to Zurich. I kept noticing no inventory -- but sometimes quite a showroom.

One trip, I went to the new Audi dealership that is at the Munich airport -- I asked the rep why no inventory? He told me that almost all of the cars they sell are ordered. Almost every Audi (and BMW) that we've had since 1978 have been special order cars. I always thought if you're going to spend ($50K+ in today's $s) and will settle for your third color option and not getting the options you wanted, etc, there must be something wrong with your sense of money. Why pay that much for a car that you wouldn't ever special order, but you'll take it because you can pick it up on Monday?

The 10th (so they say) largest BMW dealer is here in Cincinnait. We have two Audi dealerships, two BMW, three Mercedes, two Porsche, etc etc, stores in our Big Town (almost a small city). I have, many times, attempted to find THE car I wanted in stock -- ""can't be done!"" My most recent Audi was $57+K and my wife's SQ5 was $65+K. At what level of income does one have to achieve in order to settle for a $60K car that is ""sitting on the lot?""

I wanted blind spot monitoring and red leather. I also wanted all-season OEM tires. My wife also wanted blind spot and red leather -- but she wanted metallic black, while I wanted white. I would've probably taken the metallic white Audi offers, but I was very specific in what I wanted as was she.

What I can't imagine is being willing to settle on in-stock inventory, unless the exact vehicle was available or unless the price was hugely discounted. I took my 2012 Acura TL with a black leather interior -- a color I said I would never have (it makes the inside of the car feel small, to me at least, plus it is hotter than hell in the summer and the black seats often fade and look cheap) -- because the price was steeply discounted. What was I thinking? That fugly interior may have contributed to my relatively short time with the thing.

So, here is the other ""benefit"" of ordering your car: it kind of feels like you get ""the new car joy"" twice, once when you order it and once a couple of months later when it comes in.

Ordered cars, too, generally cost less than ones from inventory. The reason? The dealer doesn't have to pay the interest on the cars while they sit in inventory -- the dealer has a customer the moment the car comes in. Floorplan costs for your ordered car are likely to be very low.

When I see one of those mega dealerships with a 150 car showroom and a huge (acres) lot -- one so big you have to be shuttled to the location of the car you're going to look at -- I assume someone has to pay for that, and I assume it will be the customers.

The tiny dealer can order the same car as the big guy -- so if you're looking for the best deal, well the dealer that is so big the TV commercials have to be shot from a helicopter, is the one to avoid. Sometimes, Small really is Beautiful."
1739,"March 9, 2015 6:13AM",graphicguy,"Mark....like you. many times I've bemoaned the fact that the BMW dealers just seem to carry the ""middle of the road"" colors and options on their cars. My BMW dealer (Sweeney) is a little bit better than the other place as far as having stock that meets my wants closer. But still, it's a struggle to find exactly what I want.

As you noted, the two Audi stores are even worse. Mercedes dealers seem to be a bit better, but I'm not really a fan of their cars. So, outside of helping my sister buy one, and the cursory looks I give them when I'm shopping, I can't mention whether their stock situation is good or not.

I know whenever I've become frustrated with the selection when buying a BMW, my long time sales associate is more than willing to order something. I never have. But, depending on their cycle of ordering, he's said it takes between 4 to 6 weeks from ordering until I'd be picking it up.

I can see the allure for the dealership. No floor plan to pay. It's pretty much a guaranteed sale, getting exactly the car YOU want. And, price is agreed up front (or at least it should be).

I've been to one of the Porsche dealers. Like their cars, but the dealership acted like I was invisible. I passed by two sales offices where the sales person looked up to see me, and ignored me. I passed two in the showroom who wouldn't even make eye contact.

No Porsches for me."
1740,"March 9, 2015 6:31AM",cdnpinhead,"I had exactly the same experience when I visited a BMW store in Scottsdale in 1999, back when BMWs were BMWs. Haven't darkened the door of a BMW dealership since."
1741,"March 9, 2015 8:31AM",dino001,"Why pay that much for a car that you wouldn't ever special order, but you'll take it because you can pick it up on Monday?

That's what I say. I think same principle applies even to much cheaper cars. Considering that they are often even bigger portion of buyer's income (i.e. price of Ford Focus is most likely higher percentage of their buyer's income than those buying new 3- or 5-series; not always, but more often than not).

I never understood American ""have to have it today"" culture. Ironically, the need for instant gratification, today considered a ""core American value"", is a far departure from thrift and patience were virtues preached by the first settlers, but that's another story. As I was saying many times before, part of my attraction of German brands to me is the real ability to get something that's in the catalogue. The salesmen never complain, never roll their eyes, or repeatedly attempt to sell you what's there here and now. I consider a single proposal acceptable, what I hate is a hard push against clearly expressed customer's wish. Many other brands have ""phantom"" configurations, options and packages that can be specified together as ""available"", but not really available - not just not in stock, but simply not possible to get, even with waiting. When ask, you get this blank stare, like you just arrived from another planet. Some dealers would pretend to take an order and then try to fit what they have in the pipeline. Two months later, you get a phone call: there is one coming, just your color and option X, but it has a sunroof that you didn't ask for, is that OK? I've seen that too many times.

My only beef with German brand dealers, is that there are some options that truly change the car's characteristics, but not available in stock. Case in point - BMW 3 and 4 series have this adaptive M-sport suspension, which may or may not be a good thing. It is the only way to get a sport suspension on their AWD models, where Sport and M-Sport lines are only decorative aesthetic options (as opposed to RWD models, where sport suspension is added). I'm still yet to see any car in stock with that option. So should I want an X-drive car (e.g. wagon or GT models comes only with that that), I'd like to know how that adaptive M-sport suspension would work, if it's worth that extra thousand bucks, or not. I can't. Well, I'll live, I guess. Most likely I'll get RWD 4-series with Sport Line, anyway."
1742,"March 9, 2015 8:39AM",dino001,"I think that's the price we pay for much lower price point on those cars. As you may know, Europeans pay often more than double for the same vehicles. I checked it - literally my $46K MSRP wagon in 2013 would have been around $100K over there. At that level, volumes must be significantly lower, but the choices are much bigger. Rather than three engines, you get something like eight. Interior comes both bundled and unbundled, same thing with convenience and performance options. Our option sheet for a model is three-four pages, theirs are fifty-page books. We enjoy lower price at expense of choices, limited even further by dealers catering to our own instant culture. They can be very particular, what to buy, but they pay for that privilege. To each their own, I guess.

BTW, there are similar market differences in electronics. When I was first buying some audio equipment (long time ago), I was struck how little choice was there in a big box store, despite all that square footage in comparison with a typical European store, especially in ""above entry level, below upscale"" category."
1743,"March 9, 2015 10:00AM",flightnurse,"I was talking to our CA yesterday he was informing me that BMW has not released their ED allocation yet for the 2016 MY (something I already knew.) Chapman BMW has 2 2014 328i GT, both with M sport package, both equipped the same way. chapmanbmw.com/Phoenix-BMW-3-Series-2014-BMW-328i+xDrive+Gran+Turismo-440868.htm Our CA was telling me that we can get the car for 9K off MSRP plus the additional $1500 for in stock unit, then add the $1K rebate from BMWNA for being a BMWCCA member, Its a nice offer, but the car has black interior, the exterior is the Estoril Blue Metallic. Rick does not want Black interior living here in the SW that is the last color one wants to have.

What I find interesting is, the CA say's, the GM orders the cars based on what people buy, this makes sense, however, I told him if the GM only orders cars with black interior and people purchase what is in stock does that really mean that black interior is what they want? Most of the 3 series they have in stock has, black interior, I would beat that many who purchase 2 and 3 series do not know they can order their cars and of course the CA's are going to say anything about as they do not make money until the car is delivered.

Now on a side note, my CA informed that BMW has raised the residual on the 5 series from 60% to 64% on all 5 series excluding M5's, So this means you can get into a 5 series for less then $500/m on a 36 month lease."

1747,"March 9, 2015 11:32AM",markcincinnati,"When we ordered my wife's two X3's we did order the sport seats, the sport steering wheel, etc -- we also got sport wheels with +1"" wheel size and wide and lower profile tires.

Two things struck me:

#1 if you get the package with the sport steering wheel, you can't have the wheel heated.

#2 no matter what ""sport"" option you selected, there was nothing that changed the calibration or ride height -- i.e., there was no sport suspension. The best you could do to sport the thing up was the bigger wheels and tires, which do help somewhat -- but the overall suspension is the same with or without the sport options.

Audi has a package they call ""SLine"" that is or was available -- and it did (on the A4 at least) offer sport seats, +size wheels and tires and lower ride height, stiffer springs, struts and thicker anti-roll bars (front and reat). Sometimes they even included a special steering wheel but they did include paddle shifters too when one ticked off the ""SLine"" option.

I see the A6, too, can be had with an all season or summer only sport package which does alter the suspension to ""sport"" calibration.

According to the special brochure, Audi's S cars have ""special S tuned"" suspensions which I believe our friends over on AudiWorld.com say is different from the sport package offered on the A4 and A6.

Why BMW chose NOT to offer a sport suspension on their X-drive cars is a mystery to me -- they surely must have the technical know how to engineer it, one would think.

Tires contribute to the cars handling, doh!, you already knew that. So, here is something you can do that you may find has value to you. When you order a new Audi S4 with the all-season tire option, it comes with 18"" wheels and 40 series tires. The optional tire package comes with 19"" wheels and 35 series tires.

The all-season tires are H rated grand touring Continentals or other Name Brand all-season tires. When you graduate to the 19"" wheels, the tires are Z rated (at least) and could be Continentals -- but they are MaxPerformance tires.

The difference, here in America, at least is that the Continental tires are ""good,"" but unless kept inflated to at least 42 pounds, they are built for comfort, not for performance. Why Audi chose H rated tires is beyond me.

When ordering the 19"", the tires are summer only rubber that helps the car go like a snake in a rat hole when compared with the H rated grand touring rubber.

So, what you can do, if you are an American who doesn't need or won't swap out tires twice per year, is go ahead and get the all seasons that come with the thing and upgrade (it is called +Zero) to a wider, lower profile Ultra high performance tire that will fit on the 18"" wheels -- or you can keep the same size tires but get UHP all-seasons. The difference is not subtle -- the car's willingness to turn in is cranked up to 11, it then really does go like a snake in a rat hole, and you won't be obliged to swap out your tires semi-annually.

Here's the deal, I THINK: European manufacturers, attempting to cater to American tastes, try to err on the side of comfort, quietness and durability beyond 25,000 miles. In doing so, I think they go too far. Why would Audi (for example) put H rated Grand-Touring tires on an ""S"" (not SLine) vehicle? I replaced ours with W rated UHP DWS Continentials (all season, Dry Wet, Snow), inflated the fronts to 43 and the rears to 41 -- transformation!

With virtual mass customization the norm these days, why not offer Grand Touring, All-Season Ultra High Performance and Summer only Maximun Performance tire options on the order form and be done with it?

Or at least think: BMW ""M"" is supposed to be more than an emblem or decal, more than trim and bling; likewise ""S"" (for Audi) is supposed to be a special version of a given Audi model, that includes sport: seats, exhaust, suspension, steering wheel and pedal covers, AND (one would think) TIRES. Somehow both Audi and BMW have an incomplete circuit somewhere that seems to prevent the inclusion of all of the required ingredients that go along with the notion of a ""sport model"" designation.

Let's see what Volvo and Mercedes offer . . . . hmm?"

They do - it's called M-Sport Adaptive suspension, sold together with variable sport steering as Dynamic Handling Package priced at $1000 for 3- and 4- series. On X3, they're selling same name package with somewhat different content."

Oh, horse feathers! If it is true it's because most buyers don't want to take the time and effort to order, and they'll settle for what's in stock. They want immediate gratification.

At least, in the case of our A4, although it's a pearlescent white, the interior being beige came with the rare dark brown carpeting matching the dark wood in the car, a nice combo."
1750,"March 9, 2015 2:12PM",ab348,"I had a similar conversation at my dealer when I got the ATS. Their response was almost identical. All they tend to bring in are black, white and silver cars with black interiors. Very rarely will they bring in a vehicle without a black interior regardless of exterior color. It is bizarre."
1751,"March 9, 2015 4:33PM",markcincinnati,"White is the new black. According to our BMW store white is the most popular color. Black and silver are also popular.

White and gloss black are often the only two ""free"" paint colors offered by European mfgrs. My wife pulled the trigger on a $1,075 paint color called Panther Black -- yes it is purty, but that just seems like way too much for what appears BLACK from a distance of over 10 feet.

I used to special order Pearl White on all my Audis. Then, one year, the price jumped from $500 to $2,500 and Pearl White became a member of the Special Order collection that Audi offers to anyone who will pony up the money. It is called Audi exclusive -- hell yes it is exclusive, because anything you order -- ANYTHING -- starts at $2,500 -- why? Because they can.

In 2009, I wanted the Ecru (Cardamom) interior color and it only came with blonde wood -- I thought the contrast wasn't there, I wanted the burl walnut wood inlays. At that time, $2,000. Despite the fact that I had custom ordered the A4 Pretige with most every option listed, I just couldn't bring myself to pay $2K for something that was no charge had I not wanted the Cardamom leather. Next year blonde was dropped in favor of the dark walnut.

Much as I favor an almost the sky's the limit, I just can't see something like I have just described as anything other than an option from our ""shameless profit collection.""

BMW seems to charge breathtaking prices for wheels that aren't part of the two or three ""normal"" choices offered -- I know there are certainly differences that justify higher costs, but there was an X6 on the showroom floor with a $5,000 wheel package (tires were another upcharge).

I know a lot of options are outrageously priced, but at least it would seem they kind of bury the charge so that the price gouging isn't obvious.

Now I'll show my ignorance -- the last time I priced an Infiniti, their color palate was ""included"" in the MSRP base. This included both pearl and just clearcoat colors.

I'm the guy who would probably pay MORE for the basic car if all the paint choices were ""included"" -- it just galls me to see $1,075 for an admittedly pretty black color. It is good that I actually prefer white, cause were they to start charging extra for gloss white, I'm sure I'd scream ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore!""

Sheesh!"

Which???"
1764,"March 10, 2015 4:18PM",markcincinnati,"The problem I have with the statement would entirely go away if the words between the parenthesis had not been part of the declaration.

Furthermore, my issue with most of these cars -- but the Germans top the list of offenders -- rears its head because I typically select the top option package and then add individual options on top of that.

A base (good luck finding one) Audi S4 is hard to beat -- but I wouldn't have one unless it had, navigation, B&O sound system, blind spot monitoring . . . and the list goes on. There is no way the technology we (or I) love, voice-activated navigation + bluetooth, etc, is worth $3,500. Hell, I can buy a 75"" Samsung HDTV for about $500 less than that, and that price is dropping 2% per month.

So, yeah, there are very good cars at attractive price points -- we can argue if this or that is BETTER than a BMW or an Audi or a Mercedes, etc, but there are a lot of comparable cars IF POPULARLY equipped. My car has almost $10,000 worth of options on it, and I didn't even get a Prestige model.

The base fill in the blank German fill in the blank is likely to drive, perform and ride better than the ""other guy"" -- but the heck of it is, the German car will be a strippie and the other guy will come chock full of features that just seem out of touch with even a generous gross margin.

Now, having said that, I will prove myself a walking and driving contradiction. I do, to this very day, believe that the Acura TLX SH-AWD with the Advance package (and ONLY that configuration) is Acura's S4. And, it is really damn near impossible to find one that rings up a $50,000 tab. Yet, if you drive the two cars, back to back, well there is that certain something (that my wife calls soul) that the Acura doesn't even seem to attempt to imitate. But the TLX's numbers are, for the bucks, impressive.

So, I complain about the price of the S4 vs the TLX (which makes a good case for itself as being in the same league), but I still put down the extra $6K-$12K for the Audi BECAUSE I test drove it.

Only if enough folks spend the money and actually buy a manual transmission car, will they even be available too much longer. Automatic transmissions today improve the performance (or at least the perception of performance) of many, if not most, of the cars they are marketed with.

And, in terms of the utilization and circumstances of use by the majority of consumers (again for mere mortals), AWD no longer needs to have any apologies made for it or by it, other than to say, ""excuse me"" as the AWD version passes the RWD or FWD version. Ask Porsche, to name one, what cars they market are AWD -- the low performance or high performance variants?

I can appreciate RWD and manual transmissions -- but they're not, for the buyers that keep these ELLPS car mfgs alive and well, where the ""performance"" buyers gravitate towards.

The reasons are well documented and even if I did think RWD and manual transmissions were any more than an entry in the bibliography of a glitzy brochure (if brochures actually had bibliographies), the shoppers, buyers and actual consumers believe and behave differently (based on their spending, at least); that is auto trans cars rule and AWD is in very widespread use, often in the cars touted as THE highest performance versions.

The sooner we start recognizing that these companies that build the machines we covet probably don't care one way or another what wheels are driven and how the thing is shifted, the better, because they care overwhelmingly what will facilitate the goals of corporate survival, growth and prosperity. I would assume if BMW thought it could overwhelm Audi by building and selling FWD cars exclusively with manual transmissions, I would assume they would do so.

A dead purist is still dead, after all. Companies are no different -- the auto transmission has or is close to defeating stick shifts; turbo or super or both engines of 4 or 6 cylinders are replacing displacement based engines as each day passes and AWD cars or at least the option to add AWD is well on its way toward total market dominance.

I like being alive -- but, in my case at least, I actually think auto trans AWD vehicles are the best most of us mere mortals can get today. So I think I am a purist, just one who thinks RWD (or FWD) and stick shifts are so 1980."

It is funny. You and I are on opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to options. I think cars are really expensive to begin with. So I choose my options carefully. If I'm going for a BMW, then its going to have the lighting package, backup camera, heated seats, AWD, & a slush box. That's it. My former E90 328xi was loaded up with options that didn't really add that much to the driving experience. Sure the leather seats were really nice & the sunroof let light into its black interior. The Navigation got me 95% of the way to my destination.

Now I definitely like the way sport package equipped cars drive and look. Nowadays they are really expensive option packages that come with low profile, run flat tires that can get expensive, especially around here."

1770,"March 11, 2015 5:55AM",graphicguy,"WE have been down this road before regarding manual transmissions. Yeah, they are fun. But, today's automatics are SO GOOD, I don't know of anyone who can actually putperform one with a manual. Tough to find any manual transmission cars, anywhere, regardless of price. Yes, you can special order them. But, dealers know if they stock them, it's a long road ahead trying to find a customer who knows how to drive one, let alone, finding someone who wants one. They're out there. They're a acarcity, though.

Even something like a Mustang GT or Camaro SS are tough to find in a manual trans. They're a bit more plentiful, but you have to search some to locale them.

I think most of the trade rags give the nod to the Cadillac ATS when it comes to 3 Series, A4 etc comparisons. I've driven an ATS, several times. They are a very fun car to drive that can rock and roll with anything in its price range. Good looking and built well with great materials, too.

I agree with Mark....on the upper end of the ELLPS range, probably the S4 could arguably be preferred over the others. Audi, at least in my exeperience (and some others here at Edmunds) aren't exactly the poster children for reliability, nor are they reasonably budget friendly to keep and operate. Still, can't argue its performance.

Acura TL SH AWD Advance? Boy....I would have a hard time justifying $50K-$60K for a 3xx ix or A/S4, C300/400 4 Matic if I were looking for a level of performance, comfort, build quality, cheap to own and operate for what I paid for mine ($38K and change). I don't have enough seat time in the TLX SH AWD to really render a judgement. But, for $45K list for the advance package, the same applies to it.

If it weren't just a wee bit tight for my tastes, I would have had a Lexus is350 F sport gracing the GG estate right now. It's a lot like the Acura TL. It doesn't lead in one category, but is really good in ALL categories. At the time, I could have plucked one up, fairly loaded for $46-$47K, too. It's design could be polarizing, too. But again, being the ""odd ball"" I am, likeing the TL's previous design, I liked the Lexus' design, too.

I understand people being polarized by the styling. But, no one can deny their trouble free nature, longevity, sport sedan handling and frugality when it comes to operation and maintenance. They are a LOT of car for that kind of money.

So, are their better cars out there than the 3 Series? From my perspective, yes....lots of them. My reasons may be different than yours, though. You start loading one up to knock on the $60K+ door, and that list grows dramatically."
1771,"March 11, 2015 8:23AM",markcincinnati,"Thanks, but I did know that it is possible to get the BMW you mention (as well as several Audis, etc.) with a manual. The point that I was making is they represent what 1%, 2%, or maybe 3% of sales? They are becoming a ""why bother"" to manufacture feature. WE'VE killed manual transmissions. We're about to kill driving altogether. See my next post."
1772,"March 11, 2015 8:24AM",markcincinnati,"In·ev·i·ta·ble: unable to be avoided, evaded, or escaped; certain; sure to happen.

Our sometimes heated discussions about the merits of manual transmissions vs. automatics or about RWD, FWD, AWD, etc. are – or will pretty soon be – irrelevant. These discussions may be entertaining, they may even be cathartic, but there is plenty of evidence of the inevitability of semi-autonomous and ultimately autonomous cars.

With google, Apple and many others you’ve never even heard of working on technologies whose purpose it is to remove you from the driving equation, it is a matter of years – perhaps so few we could discuss the time frame in months (you know like a 60 month car-loan term) – before we essentially have “individual” mass transportation. By that I mean we’ll have individual containers (cars) that, as far as you’re concerned, provide you with about the same experience you have as when riding a bus, limo or train. You’ll have the flexibility that a private car offers and you’ll be, for the most part, nothing more than a passenger.

It probably doesn’t even matter if you want this technology or not, it’s coming. It’s coming pretty quickly too. Insurance and many other private companies, federal, state and local governments want it. You’ve (or perhaps, better said, “we’ve”) proven we’re not capable, or perhaps it is just that we’re not willing to prevent the inevitable. Just this morning, coming into work, I passed a driver of a late model Mercedes S class – the driver was on the phone! There is no way this Mercedes doesn’t come standard with hands-free, eyes-free, voice activated Bluetooth connectivity and control; yet, there was this bozo with one hand on the road, in rush-hour traffic, with the phone held up to his ear. Now, how does that make me make the leap to autonomous cars?

Well, as I am willing to say, I am often wrong, but never uncertain, we might simply mandate built in jammers that prevent cell phone usage in a moving car. But, think about it, what we really want is for the driver to not use a hand-held phone while driving. We probably don’t want to prohibit passengers from using a cell phone. Even my Audi offers in-car Wi-Fi, so it seems that we’re moving in the direction of greater, not restricted, connectivity. So what do “we” do? Rather than taking away the ability for the driver to use a hand-held phone, we’ll just go ahead and take away the ability to drive the car altogether because we have demonstrated that distracted driving is sometimes actually worse than drunk driving – and if you bother to look, you’ll find there are a lot of drivers using hand-held phones. This is all the more frustrating (for me at least) since I know that an ever increasing number of cars have Bluetooth as standard equipment.

Inevitable? Yes. While growing up, my parent’s cars never had seatbelts – in 1963 my dad bought a brand new Chrysler Newport. It did not come with seatbelts. The dealer, however, did put them in the car (2 in the front seat only). I never knew if this was in response to a government mandate or if it was part of a promotion. As time passed we graduated to cars that came with 3 seatbelts in the front (unless you had bucket seats), then rear seatbelts, then shoulder belts then seatbelt interlocks that essentially attempted to force seatbelt use as the cars would not start unless the seatbelts were fastened (leading to folks fastening their seatbelts, then sitting on them, therefore defeating the purpose.)

We can, in the name of safety, list all of the inevitable features that have been added since 1963 – actually, we could have another list of all of the features added in the name of safety before 1963. These two lists, with descriptions, would fill volumes.

These days, any manufacturer who wants to, can crank out a 300HP motor and put it in a lightweight body. And they can do so for what is (for someone my age) an almost unbelievably low price. Even 350HP, 400HP or 500HP are pretty much within the engineering talents of just about any name brand auto manufacturer. Likewise, 6,7,8,9 and 10 speed automatics, some with dual clutches and torque converters (in the same transmission) further multiply many car’s accelerative capabilities sometimes stretching the limits of the short-attention span humans we’ve seen increasing on the planet at an alarming rate. When 0-60MPH can happen in less than 6 seconds and when, at 60MPH, you’re overtaking anything not moving at a rate of 88 feet per second, it’s no wonder untrained and distracted drivers crash and burn.

The response? Intervention. Police intervention? Sure, but often that is after it is too late. What is, apparently, better is for the car to intervene on the driver’s behalf. First came four-wheel brakes, eventually disc brakes, then anti-locking brakes, then electronic stability programs, then radar/sonar pre-sense systems, cameras and more cameras, lane warning systems, lane keeping systems, systems meant to keep you awake, systems that can bring a car to a full-stop and maintain assured clear distances at highway speeds approaching triple digits. Then there are the slow speed crash avoidance systems, pedestrian safe-keeping systems, night vision systems, automatic mirrors and automatically deployed headlight beams that dim whenever approaching traffic is detected. Infiniti, despite much negative press, even disconnected the steering wheel from the steered wheels altogether as they designed – perhaps intentionally, who knows – a semi-autonomous car, the Q50. Google has demonstrated their autonomous driving handiwork, too, in a Mercedes S-class; and recently an Audi A7 (or so it appeared to be) navigated, at speed, the Nürburgring. Look ma, no hands!

Recently, I have, with humorous intent, invoked the quote from Pogo, “We’ve met the enemy and he is us.” Now, without mirth, I re-invoke the saying and once again, I blame you (all of us, really) for not learning how to drive, not learning safety and performance driving. I blame us, as a culture, as a species, for not making the requirements for getting an automobile driving license perhaps nearly as rigorous as the requirements to get a private airplane pilot’s license.

If we all had to know how to drive defensively – and prove it – we could, perhaps, forestall the inevitable autonomous automobiles currently picking up speed in the pipeline to a retailer near you. Yes, forestall, not prevent, because eventually, even great education won’t be enough, great engineering will prove inadequate and “traffic law” enforcement will always remain mostly an after-the-fact activity rather than robust preventative measures.

I – alone at my house, anyway – pretty much welcome autonomous cars, because driving on our I-275 with the apparently ignorant [great] majority of the population (and I include myself) is just too much Sturm und Drang (Storm and Stress). I have this wonderful 333HP sporty sedan and I drive it mostly in stop and go traffic, bumper-to-bumper (no matter how hard I try to maintain one car length for every 10MPH) and at about 47MPH (or less, truth be told). The hell of it is, I live in Cincinnati – have you ever been here? This place is barely a city for pity’s sake; it is so small, so relatively sparsely populated. I can only imagine the frustration of having an S4 in Chicago or Boston or Dallas. Hell yes, gimmie a car that I can program to my destination, push or say “engage,” meanwhile I work on my iPad mini catching up on my [State Department] emails and other mi·nu·ti·ae: The small, precise, or trivial details of something.

At least if I’m in my car, not having fun driving it, I can be in my car not having fun but at least being somewhat productive.

Soichiro Honda was a very talented engineer, and I think his ""soul,"" if you want to talk in those terms, is still part of Honda/Acura.

1774,"March 11, 2015 10:39AM",markcincinnati,"My wife calls the differences between her last car, an Infiniti and my last car, an Acura, a lack of soul. I understand that she probably means something that is there but very difficult to quantify -- it can't be measured and written down, that is.

I did, mostly, enjoy my 2012 TL (most especially the audio system -- I still have the DVD-Audio discs), were I to even attempt to characterize what I could articulate differentiated the TL vs the S4, it would start with a sense that the Acura seemed ""flimsy,"" most notable when closing the doors. The Audi closes with a muted, solid whomph! sound, no clicking or other mechanical noises, the door closing almost seems hydraulic it is so smooth so ""of a billet of solid steel"" invoking. The Acura on the other hand, sounded a bit like an empty tin can being dropped from about 5 feet onto asphalt. The very comfortable, heated and ventilated seats, in the Acura also had a bit of ""play"" or give in them somewhat like a table at a bar that needs a folded pack of matches put under one of the legs to keep it from wobbling. I don't know if I would call the Acura's feel something as negative as ""OK fit and finish,"" perhaps I would simply call it ""less solid"" feeling than the Audis (or BMWs) we've had.

If that equates to soul (my wife's term, remember), well there you have it. Please remember I am not saying I think the Acura is not a good car, a very high value car, a fully-featured car with lots of impressive technology. I also thought the SH-AWD with the 19"" wheel tire package made the TL elicit a sense of deja vu -- like it was, somehow, related or at least relate-able to an S4.

I, at age 63, now think life's too short (for me, at least) to drive an Acura TL or TLX when there are cars like the S4 on the market.

But, if you read my previous post, in probably doesn't matter since most cars will be nearly autonomous before the note on your new car is paid off."

1778,"March 11, 2015 12:02PM",flightnurse,"Mark, Audi does not built a RWD drive car that has a 50/50 weight distribution, neither does MB, Infiniti or Lexus. I agree that the automatics of today are just as good if not better. The 8 spd in my 320i with the coded Sport Transmission is a great unit, I can cruise in comfort and not feel it shift, or if I want to be sporty and hold the rev's longer, I push the toggle switch to Sport, and if I want to push it harder, I'll push the toggle switch again and the transmission goes into Sport+. Then the transmission shifts quicker, and will hold to redline until I move the shift down for a higher gear (320i's do not have paddle shifters from the factor, but can be added via the aftermarket for about $500.)

When people talk about the car in the past being better, this reminds me of when my EX and I had a couple of classic cars, he had a 57 Continental Mark II (Please do not call it a Lincoln Continental) and I had a 70 Olds 442 Convertible W30 and a 70 Mustang 302. The Olds was the classic A body car. Yes, it was fast but not really THAT fast, the Mustang was quick, faster then the Olds, but not as fast or quick or quick as cars in the late 90's, and lets talk comfort, the Olds was an Auto, the Mustang was a stick, the clutch on the stang was SOOOO stiff it was rough to drive it around town or smooth. The Continental rode like it was on clouds, smooth and elegant, but trying to stop 2.5 tons of car with drum brakes, was a feat... Even the Olds and stang had disk brakes up front they still didn't stop all that well. So when I hear people talk about the good ole days of cars and how good they are, I just laugh.. Give me a 335i with sport package, a car that is faster, smooth, handles better and is suited for the long haul over the older muscle cars. Even the 2015 Stang GT is faster, and is a lot more comfortable to drive and handles so much better..

1802,"March 16, 2015 3:34PM",benjaminh,"As this article says, it's very difficult these days to compete with the ""big 3"" of luxury: BMW, Lexus, and MB....

http://www.autonews.com/article/20150316/RETAIL01/303169995/tier-2-luxury-brands-struggle-to-compete-with-elite-germans-lexus

""....The big three brands enjoy an enviable combination of advantages -- deep product lineups, global reach, strong residual values and rock-solid brand images -- that aspiring brands cannot match.

Cross-shopping data show that customers of the aspiring brands are more likely to defect to one of the big three or Audi than the other way around.

Not since 1998 has any brand other than BMW, Mercedes and Lexus topped the U.S. luxury market in sales. That year, Lincoln led the field. Before 1998, Cadillac held an unbroken grip on the top spot going back to before 1970.

Since Mercedes grabbed the top prize in 1999, imports have dominated the playing field. Lexus ruled 11 straight years from 2000-10. These days, the top three remain locked in a bitter struggle for the luxury title. BMW has taken the crown three of the last four years but is third so far this year, trailing Mercedes and Lexus.

Ambitious Lexus is breathing down the neck of Mercedes-Benz in a bid to regain the top spot it hasn't held since 2010. Through February, Lexus sales have jumped 26 percent, passing BMW to move into second place behind Mercedes. Like its rivals, Lexus is basing its growth on an aggressive product offensive....

Acura finished sixth in the U.S. behind Cadillac in 2014 but has jumped past Audi and Cadillac into fourth place for the first two months of 2015, demonstrating just how hot the competition is among the aspiring brands...."""

This is the second time the dealer has given me an X1, and I really do like those little trucks. The steering and brake feel is spot on and the size is just about right- although it is a extremely porky at over 3800 lbs. 0-60 in 6 seconds is nothing to write home about, but adequate for its intended purpose. I could actually see owning an M Sport X1 xDrive 35i. While still no ball of fire(0-60 in 5.2 seconds) the truck would be a lot of fun for a second car or work hack."

1805,"March 16, 2015 10:44PM",roadburner,That would be a nice sled as well- especially if Alpina had their way with it...
1806,"March 17, 2015 4:22AM",cdnpinhead,"I bet I know the answer, but I'll ask anyway. Is that X3 available with a manual transmission? Which diesel is it?"
1807,"March 17, 2015 5:36AM",nyccarguy,No MT (this is BMW we are talking about after all). It is a 2.0L 4cyl Turbo Diesel. 180 hp - 280 lb ft torque.
1808,"March 17, 2015 5:41AM",graphicguy,"RB....While I was having my issues with my previous Audi, I looked pretty closely at those X1s. I thought in 35i guise, it was a nice little vehicle.

1812,"March 17, 2015 12:44PM",henryn,"Most people would consider 0-60 in 5.2 seconds to definitely be a ""ball of fire"". Complete with flames."
1813,"March 17, 2015 3:36PM",roadburner,5.2 seconds is definitely mid-pack these days. A dead stock 1st. Generation MS3 can do it in 5.4 seconds. Any of the V8 ponycars with at least 400 hp can do 0-60 in 4.5 seconds or less. To be considered very fast these days I'd think that a car has to go 0-60 in under 4 seconds- and 0-100 in under 11 seconds. The goalposts have moved quite a bit.
1814,"March 17, 2015 3:38PM",roadburner,"To each his own, my tweaked MS3 is only a tick faster; I can't say it's slow, but it's not a rocketship by current standards."

1816,"March 17, 2015 5:33PM",roadburner,"Same here; it really feels different from the newer cars. Contrast that with the X6 I drove at the press intro a few months ago- it was pretty quick but dull as dishwater to drive; a totally uninvolving steer, as the Brits would say."
1817,"March 17, 2015 5:34PM",robr2,"You know, we've got it pretty good. In the 80's and early 90's, a 0-60 of under 10 seconds was IMPRESSIVE."
1818,"March 17, 2015 6:08PM",roadburner,"I'd say that was true in the '70s, but not in the '80s or '90s. My 1988 M6 could do 0-60 in the high 5 second range with a Dinan or Conforti chip. The 325i and 535i were 7 second cars, easy. The Mustang GT and Z28 were also 6 second cars by the late '80s."
1819,"March 17, 2015 6:53PM",nyccarguy,"Agree with your assessment. I've driven a friend's F10 ///M5. The car was insanely fast, yet utterly uninspiring. I've told him a few times that the ///M5 wasn't ""the car"" to buy at the $130K price point. He couldn't swing (or should I say, his wife's trust fund woudn't allow) the $150K plus for a Panamera Turbo and wouldn't drive a ""regular"" Panamera 4S because it wasn't the fastest ""top of the line"" model."
1820,"March 17, 2015 6:56PM",Mr_Shiftright,"I kinda doubt one would even feel the difference between a 4.5 car and a 5.0 car. To me, radical speed is something like the Ariel Atom, which is under 3 seconds and probably feels completely different from a 4.5 car."
1821,"March 17, 2015 7:07PM",sweendogy,Would say this 0-6O just a measure - real world passing is where its at on the highway - being able to just blast the gas at 45 and loook down and see 65/70 in a blink is where its at. Did it today just to get around slower traffic: gonzo - pretty good 2/3/5/7 seconds (dk.)
1822,"March 17, 2015 7:19PM",dino001,"European magazines have additional additional tests, not known here, such as equivalent of going from 40 to 60 mph, or 50 to 75 mph on on highest, or second highest gear to assess flexibility of the engine, as well as its performance. This was especially important for manual transmission cars, to get you feel how much you need to operate that stick."
1823,"March 17, 2015 7:34PM",nyccarguy,"Like in my Prelude. Loafing along at 70 in 5th & need to pass? Drop down to 3rd & up shift back up to 4th at 80;)

The Legacy gets the job done. It's far from the fastest car on the road, but it doesn't complain when I floor it at 70 to pass a slow roller and it has to hit 90 to get by:)"
1824,"March 17, 2015 8:02PM",roadburner,"That is a good point, since flexibility-as you note-is also an important performance parameter. It's one place my MS3 really does shine; stock it did 50 to 70 mph in sixth gear in 6.7 seconds, and the minor tweaks to my car have dropped that time to 5.9 seconds- a fairly low number that not many cars can match.

Contrast that with my Club Sport; which needs to be kept above 4,000 rpm to make reasonably rapid progress. The Bimmer actually made me a better driver as there's not enough horsepower to cover up mistakes such as over-braking or blowing a corner. Horsepower can cover up a multitude of sins; it's harder for a student to ""get it"" when his first HPDE car has a lot of power and grip. I once had a B student who-driving a mildly modified E46 325i shod with R-comps-lapped an E46 M3, E92 M3, EVO VIII, and 993 in her run group. More than once. Talk about a humbling experience."
1825,"March 17, 2015 9:31PM",henryn,"Back in the day, no one ever talked about 0-60 times. It was always quarter mile times. I had a 69 Charger 440, which could get in the 13's with street tires, and in the 12's with slicks. That was pretty d___ quick for a daily driver in those days.

I remember when Car and Driver did a road test of the AC Cobra 427 (1966?). They did 0 to 100 back to 0 in 10 seconds. (I think I'm remembering that correctly.) I thought that was the epitome of performance."
1826,"March 18, 2015 12:17AM",andres3,"I think if GM wants to be treated seriously by most buyers they are going to have to make cars that don't go into limp mode at a weekend HPDE (track event) when they are extremely low miles and unmodified such as the V6 Camaro I rented. The weather was mildly warm, never got above 85 degrees the whole weekend.

Granted, you might say the V6 Camaro with an automatic transmission isn't GM's front running ""track car,"" but neither is the '06 A3 for Audi, and it NEVER went into limp mode at low miles or being left unmodified. Even modified and higher miles it usually only happened at temps above 90 degrees.

Now why would GM make cars that so easily are put into ""limp"" mode? The answer lies in previous model year rental Camaros likely BLOWING brand new transmissions and spewing fluid on the track. Solution to most car companies would be to build a better more reliable durable car with a better transmission. Solution for GM (post BK by the way) was to apparently create and/or lower threshold of going into limp mode. FAIL."
1827,"March 18, 2015 1:56AM",robr2,"As I said, under 10 was impressive. I'm thinking more pedestrian vehicles."
1828,"March 18, 2015 7:29AM",roadburner,"As I said, the goalposts have moved, 13 second quarters can now be achieved in many cases with a mildly modified hot hatch."
1829,"March 18, 2015 7:38AM",graphicguy,"I concur....I think the prevalence of all these blown motors excel once you get them rolling. Even from a dead stop, they have come to the point where there is no turbo lag because of twin turbos and twin scroll turbos. S/Cs are even better.

All of these high technology motors with DI, OHC/DOHC, turbo/SC, etc have come ot the point where they're all pretty impressive given the power AND efficeincy they offer.

I know the 2.0T in my current CTS can hold court with the ;05 Mustang GT I had some years ago. By my seat of the pants, they certainly felt similar in the thrust dept. Handling, comfort, fuel efficiency, features, build quality and materials....no contest. Caddy wins....as it should. In real world $$$$$ it was $15K more than the Mustang (maybe a little less than that, given the differences in today's dollars vs dollars 10 years ago.

On the other end of that spectrum, the old adage ""there's no repacement for displacement"" still rings true....especially in the torque dept.

But, when a motor with displacement of only 2.0L and offers nearly 300 ft/lb of torque, have to admit, that's impressive. Actually, the torque figures are better than those found in the 3.6L V6 motor they also use."
1833,"March 18, 2015 9:17AM",qbrozen,"I disagree. My 3.6L TT CTS has quite a bit more torque than the 5.0L Mustang does, and over a wider RPM band, too. While that Coyote V8 sounds great, runs smooth, revs nicely, etc, I always felt it was a bit weak in the low RPM range.

As I wrote people use to drool over my 302, but show up in a 2015 Mustang GT and those same people would walk away from the 2015 and stand next to the 1970 302 and say, this is a real muscle car...

What, exactly, befell the new 535i? Steering feel. Rather, lack of steering feel. The new electric power assist has not only rendered the steering uncommunicative—particularly on-center—but, for some reason, it has also become heavier. When you can’t determine road textures and slip angles and how hard those 19-inch Goodyear run-flats are working, you lose confidence if the roads are damp and as kinked as week-old spaghetti.

1843,"March 18, 2015 3:29PM",roadburner,"To shift gears a bit(no pun intended), I hope to do a bit more instructing this year. I find it helpful to read/re-read some of the classic books on track driving. I decided to start with Piero Taruffi's The Technique of Motor Racing. It was first published in 1959, but the basics of high performance driving(and the laws of physics) remain constant. It's not for everyone- Taruffi uses lots of equations and diagrams to illustrate basic and advanced driving principles. On the lighter side, the vintage pictures of F1 and sports car races at various tracks are entertaining as well. And as far as driver safety goes, things have moved on a bit, as there is some discussion of leather helmets as well as the pros and cons of wearing seat belts in an open car. All in all, I still find it to be a valuable read.

Some idiot in a Lexus RX 350 sidelined my 4-month old S4 by darting out of a parking lot (in an apparent left turn at exactly the wrong moment when I was going straight; colliding his front left with my front right).

He sidelined my S4 with less than a month to go for a track weekend, a track weekend I didn't want to miss being that I had missed the previous one with the club for other reasons.

Hertz (insurance rental) didn't do me any favors, in fact, they pretty much sabotaged my plans, and nearly (after over 3 weeks advance warning and notice) put me in a Buick Lacrosse. Given the choice between a Camaro RS V6 and the Buick, well, it was no choice at all. Really, they should have saved the C250 Benz for me. Most people at the track said a Focus would have been more fun to drive. I didn't end up having much fun, as the Camaro is too heavy. Next time I'll specify a Focus."
1846,"March 18, 2015 9:59PM",flightnurse,"s.
Hertz rents the Hertz Mustang GT as well as C7 or the Camero SS, I know they have them at the airport location, so if you really want a fun for that weekend, I would have taken one of them. I know when I flew into San Diego, I was always temped to just one for the few days I was going to be in town."
1847,"March 18, 2015 11:27PM",tlong,So what you are saying is that the Camaro (at least that model) isn't really a sports car but a poser car. I concur.
1848,"March 18, 2015 11:32PM",tlong,"I recently rented a BMW 328, admittedly a low end model, and I was very unimpressed by the steering feel. Frankly (and seriously), our 2007 Mazda 5 microvan has much better steering feel than that BMW did."
1849,"March 19, 2015 4:20AM",benjaminh,"The BMW 320i has 180 hp, while the 328i has 240 hp. I wondered what differences in the engine could account for that 60hp, but according to this article probably the biggest difference between the two models is in the engine software:

http://www.bimmerfest.com/news/670647/f30-320i-vs-328i-engines--part-number-comparison/

I know it's completely against where the market is going, but to me base BMW 320i with the 6 speed manual and few or no options seems somewhat appealing. It's closest, anyway, to what a BMW 5 series was 30 years ago, except it's a lot safer and has less steering feel.. MSRP in white with Sensatec comes to $33.9k."
1850,"March 19, 2015 5:53AM",dino001,"Now that's funny . It is also sad That (lack of) steering feel is one of reasons I'm not in a big hurry to get a new one. I probably will, eventually, maybe even sooner than later, as my car is going out of warranty in six months and I also like some of the aspects of this new 435i GC, but I'm just not nearly as enthusiastic, as I should be - and the one chief reason is that steering. Every time I get into it and back into my car, I just can't believe how much they messed it up.

BTW, it's not about the car not going, where it needs to - it actually does, quite well. Probably all the electronics help it correct when you turn the wheel too much. But it's like a video game, not a real car. Some may actually like it, cornering with one finger on the wheel, I don't."
1851,"March 19, 2015 6:21AM",graphicguy,"When I test drove the IS350 F sport, I've mentioned that I liked it quite a bit. But, like my previous TL, you have to spur it a bit into the upper revs to get any torque.

The Turbos/SC motors alleviate that. Plus, with twin turbos and twin scroll turbos, you don't have any noticeable turbo spool up lag.

They've come a long way.

BTW....got a note from my BMW dealer stating they want my 2011 335ix in trade, stating they'll make me an unbelievable offer for it.

They're a little slow when it comes dealing with me. That car was gone two cars ago."
1852,"March 19, 2015 7:47AM",nyccarguy,"Gotcha. I remember your S4 getting hit, fixed, fixed again, & fixed some more. You fought hard (as you should have) to have your car rebuilt back to Ingolstat factory specs as was the right thing to do given that it was 4 months old and still brand new.

Now insurance covers a rental vehicle for usually a set amount $30/ day or $50/ day. That is going to pretty much get you whatever car they want to give you. Now I know for a fact, as others have said here that most rental car companies have some sort of premium collection or dream collection that would have allowed you to rent a BMW, MB, Porsche, Corvette for a premium over the $30 or $50 per day. I don't think it is reasonable to expect an insurance company to provide you with a car to be raced on a track. I also don't think it is reasonable to expect a V6 powered Camaro with an Automatic transmission (from a rental fleet no less) to perform at any level other than a pace car on the track. I could be wrong (it happens a lot) and truth be told, I've never taken any of my cars to the track.

They are also offering $8k off msrp on some 2014s. The 2013 is a fully loaded Genesis 5.0 V-8 ""R-spec"" model with all the options, and it can be yours for just $37k.

I don't carry rental insurance given the limitations and lack of use it would receive from me. This was a 3rd party claim, and the 3rd party insurance is obligated (legally arguable, but I think I'd win in court) a ""like"" vehicle. A like Vehicle to the S4 would be an M3, C63 AMG, 335is, ATS-V, cTS-V. Usually those vehicles command $$$$$ to rent.

Given the guy was underinsured, I was warned to mitigate my costs, and so I settled on a ""premium"" rental at $38/day. Given it was Hertz's insurance side, there's like an electric fence between insurance rentals and the exotic sport or whatever they want to call them rentals. Apparently, insurance companies don't believe you should be given a ""like"" vehicle unless ""like"" just means in size. Either that, or they don't believe premium sports cars are ever involved in accidents

I was willing to pay lots MORE for an upgrade for the 3 days I needed it for the track weekend. I even agreed to pay $75 extra per day (of my own money in addition to the base agreement) over 3 weeks before the event, and still, they couldn't come up with anything worthy. They claimed the C250 was $75/day, but when I needed it, it wasn't available. Hertz is incompetent.

Next time I'll just make another contract with another company and let the $38/day car sit idle for 3 days."
1857,"March 19, 2015 9:50AM",dino001,"It's not as simple. Generally, ""like"" vehicle does exactly mean size and arguably some comfort feature content, one could also argue for safety, but that's about it. The other party liability should do reasonable effort to allow you maintaining your lifestyle without much disruption, so if your lifestyle includes some leisure activities requiring driving, then they should in theory compensate for that, but I doubt any jury or court would be too sympathetic for weekend going 100+ mph somewhere. Moreover, are you really insured for going on track in your own contract? I'd check that, if I were you - if you hit something or somebody during such an event, you may be unpleasantly surprised by exclusion on your own insurance contract. So, if you are not even insured for that under your own contract, I can see the liable party easily weasel out of their obligation, at least their insurance.

I agree, but if you are going to go that route, you might as well go for a 328i with the extra hp/torque so at least your car is fast. You'll also have to special order something like that and wait 12 weeks for it. Or you could do European delivery..."

1862,"March 19, 2015 8:14PM",markcincinnati,"The fact that I -- to this day -- love manual transmissions and that you ""and others on the more enthusiastic side"" like the ""quality"" that the car under discussion possesses (an older model BMW) makes us, perhaps, nothing more than sentimental, not necessarily correct in our critiques. ""It used to be better when -- fill in the blank -- was the rule of the day,"" is a perspective. It is, apparently, a perspective that is no longer a prudent point of view, however.

The reason is, of course, that BMW and all the other successful brands are doing everything, perhaps anything they can to retain and gain market share. I do believe that today's buyers are actually as enthusiastic, perhaps more so than those of yesteryear. Actually saying that and seeing it in ""print"" is very difficult, but I do believe it is true.

If, on the other hand, the companies that progressively and steadily abandon manual transmissions, steering feel and all the other things we unintentional (and unaware and in denial) Luddites rail on about (when we speak about the good old days from a position on high) somehow all fail, well then we can say ""I told you so.""

Look at the income statements (where and when they are available) of these companies -- if revenue goes up after some period of time after the manual transmission is more or less abandoned, etc, well there is at the very least a strong correlation that those of us who decry the current in favor of the past, are wrong.

As I recognize (and usually don't much care for) about myself: I am often wrong, but never uncertain.

We need to embrace the changes -- I would venture to guess that many, probably most of the changes we complain about are for the better.

Of course, I am certain.

I decided this time around to select a 2015 Dodge Charger R/T with Premium package. I will waste no time trying to fit this vehicle into whatever y’all have decided is the current definition of the ELLPS category. [ It certainly has a level of Luxury and Performance – and it is a Sedan. ]

I did look at & drive BMWs [ M235i ] and the S3 [ really nice ] but decided not to go that way, this time.

The focus and the execution of the Dodge is quite different than those models typically discussed here. It DOES, however, have good steering feel [ IMHO - electric assist, but well done ] and with the 5.7L V8, it has a very ‘good old days’ feel to the acceleration.

I will leave it there, for now – and check in periodically.

I've said this in the past more than once, but wanting a lighter and more nimble car that communicates what is going on at the contact patches does not make one a Luddite(as an aside, I design, install, and calibrate 7.1 Home Theater Systems for fun-Dolby Atmos next-and I also repair my own PC or laptop 99% of the time,). If there wasn't a market for those cars the Miata, the Boxster/Cayman, the CTS V/V Sport, the GTI, the 2 Series, and the M3/4- to name just a few-would be dying on the vine. I do think BMW knows exactly what it is doing- forcing the enthusiasts to move up the food chain to get cars that actually feel like a BMW from just five years ago. A few months ago I discussed this same issue with Jamie Kitman of Automobile And Sam Smith of Road and Track, and both agreed that it is more than a bit cynical to make customers pay extra in order to get a BMW that drives like a BMW should.

I suppose the question should be, ""What makes a BMW a BMW? If the roundel and the Hofmeister kink become the only things that distinguish a BMW from other cars, Munich will eventually pay the price."

Nice discussion on BMWs - old and new.

As many of you know from the CCBA forum, I've had 3 5-series (and 5 3-series - isn't that funny? ) - an E39, an E60 and most recently, an F30. The E39 and E60 were manual transmissions - a 2002 530i sport and a 2007 530xi. Loved both - still miss and regret a bit giving up the E39. I don't have the experience or knowledge to speak intelligently about what makes such a car feel the way it does (like @roadburner and others here), but I do ""get it.""

I went into the F10 knowing what it was, and what it wasn't. I certainly wasn't expecting anything like the E39. I loved the styling (particularly with the M-sport package), the pull of the engine (535i) and the comfortable and luxurious ride. In the relatively short time I had it, I appreciated those attributes for my long commute.

But, alas, my yearning for something with more feel to it (not to mention the manual transmission), won out and I bought my Mazda3 a couple weeks ago.

The look on my friends and co-workers' faces when I say I traded in my BMW for the Mazda is priceless. They're used to me trading out cars on a regular basis, but this switch just has them speechless. I kind of have my response down pat at this point - ""I appreciate all kinds of cars, and was missing a sportier feel, manual...etc. etc."" They feel better when I say I already have my next BMW picked out, but need to wait a couple years for it to come down in price."
1884,"March 20, 2015 4:18PM",qbrozen,"Well, that's cool. I'd get it in writing, though. It is one thing to have a factory-authorized tune installed by the dealer, and another to do it yourself at home, regardless of the programming parameters. Upping the boost is but a portion of the big picture."

The first level that you can basically read through the car's OBC, the second that requires the dealer's proprietary equipment, and a 3rd that only regional reps can access. Even with what they could read, the car had been logging all instances of boost going beyond stock limits. He was pretty sure the regional rep could get much more detailed info than that.

After they read the car, he came right back and said ""OK, so you obviously have a tune. Which one?"" D'oh!! But, like I said, he was cool about it."

Acura TLX (and the TL from X number of years backwards); ILX, not yet, TSX was a mistake to include previously, so no.
Audi A4/S4, allroad, and possibly the Q/SQ 5 derivatives and this includes anything under the heading B8 (and soon to be B9 designation); can't figure out if the A3/S3 has any halo effect, yet, that would allow it to be included.
BMW 3's of all flavors and iterations (which would, by definition include M's), and the X3, not sure about the X1
Cadillac ATS -- all variations; CTS excluding the current generation/iteration (or is that wrong?)
Infiniti Q50's all variants; previous gen, too.
Lexus IS (all variants)
Mercedes CLA's and C class (all variants) -- not sure about the CLA's
Volvo ""X"" 60's -- all of them, S60, XC60, etc.

We may have such an active board due to the fact that we continue to have such a wide, er, tolerance of brands.

1888,"March 20, 2015 10:29PM",m6user,"Buick Regal GS and Lincoln MKZ?  Buick is more a premium brand as it stands below Cadillac but Lincoln is surely recognized as the luxury division of FoMoCo.  Dodge is certainly not a luxury brand but Chrysler could be considered, like Buick, a premium brand but wouldn't be considered a luxury brand.  Just because a car has a bunch of electronic bells and whistles and stitching on cheap leather doesn't make it a luxury brand.  Many cars are luxurious to a degree but it doesn't make the brand a luxury brand.  Most people don't perceive Hyundai and Kia to be equal to Chevy or Ford let alone be considered a luxury brand.  Granted, they may be equal to Chevy and Ford at this point but the majority perception IMO doesn't put them there.  Perception is reality in the world we live in.

1889,"March 21, 2015 9:48AM",graphicguy,"There's a confluence of car brands that are starting to blur the lines of ELLS.

Where previously, it was defined by a 3 series, BMW has been attacked on all sides with worthy (and sometimes better) competitors. Throw in the C Class and A4 for good measure.

Can you really say that a Dodge Charger with a honkin' Hemi with probably the best GPS in the biz, real leather, all the safety gizmos on the planet can't really be considered a compettor to an M3? Just because the Dodge is less expensive, does that mean it isn't built as well, using as good or better materials than the German rivals? It seems Mercedes is trying to convince everyone that their vinyl is somehow superior to leather. Nice try, but I've felt it, smelled it, sat on/in it. It's not as good as leather, regardless of what the marketers say.

I think it's expanded. Buick could sneak in there.

Acura TLX? Sure. ILX? Debateable. Q50? Yep. Q40? Well, that's just a renamed G, which is well past its expiration date.

Lexus IS? Why not? ES? Sure. NX? CT? Not so sure about those last two.

ATS? That's the ELLPS darline right now, so that's definitely in.

A4\S4...Yep!

A6/CTS/E Class/5 Series? Probably slotted above any of those that have already been mentioned.

I don't even know anyone....even a remote someone...who owns an Infiniti M. So, not so sure that should be included.

1892,"March 22, 2015 11:42AM",markcincinnati,"One response: concerning the IS but not the ES. The P in ELLPS (and LPS) stands for? Performance. There is nothing about the ES that could even remotely be called ""performance"" if the assumption includes the ability to (quoting my wife) ""go like a snake in a rat hole."" The ES can't even go like the rat in the metaphor if you axe me.

The possible reason for [my] not including some of the cars in the fold is that they don't offer much ""L"" or ""P"" or not enough to notice. The Buick Regal, was an oversight on my part -- since it can be somewhat low on the P side, but so can an A4 or a 3 series -- I do think the ATS is a better GM example of something that can be included as a full on ELLPS, but I think I will give the Regal at least the designation as a Near-ELLPS.

The action, today, does seem to be in the realm of things that can be called ELLPS or NELLPS -- sure there are better Luxury cars and better Performance cars than those that fit into the universe of ELLPS offerings; but if you have a $45K-$65K car-buying budget, your choices are both deep and wide in the ELLPS designation.

Since LPS cars, these days, seem to have a plus size requirement, I am less and less tempted by the LPS models out there. I do wish my S4 was a bit bigger, but the A6 occupies just way too much real estate these days. I am hopeful the next gen B's from Audi (B9) figure out how to be about 10% bigger overall.

Then somebody else says A3 is not ""good enough"" for the luxury part of the definition. Classic eat the cake and have it, too.

As I wrote before, to me ELLPS doesn't exists anymore. Its original purveyors (3-series, A4, C-class) moved on to chase higher sales volumes from people with thicker wallets, their imitators moved into those leftover niches, but with their own philosophies and the category was stretched and fragmented.

Basically, any given version of those original brand cars has to lose one of the letters. Their true sports luxury versions are no longer entry level, as they cost easily over $50K, sometimes even $60K, their ""entry sports"" versions lack some features found in $15K Kia or Hyundai, which makes one wonder about the luxury part. The market fragmented into too many sections and subsections for that category to be distinct. Anything that size now can fit.

The closest model to true ELLPS in last 10 years, IMHO, was probably Infiniti G50, especially in its first couple of generations. The engine and suspension made it ""performance"", pricing made it ""entry level"", standard leather and other stuff made it luxury. I'm not saying it was the best car for the money, but I think it was closest to the definition of that category."

The E90 also has a bit better F/R weight distribution- 51/49 as opposed to 52/48 for the F22. Standing start and in-gear acceleration times are virtually identical(and adequately quick). The M235i holds a slight edge in steady state cornering and braking, which I'm virtually certain is due to the E90 wearing Bridgestone Potenza RE050A I RFTs and the F22 being fitted with ""go flat"" Michelin Pilot Super Sports- I can vouch for the Michelins; I run 225/45-18 PSS on my Mazdaspeed 3 as my summer/track tire and I always run out of courage before I run out of grip.

I'm just throwing a number out there for starters, but the idea is that, for example, Jag's XF was previously their lowest car, and with a starting point of $50k, it doesn't qualify as ""entry level."""
1918,"March 23, 2015 11:55AM",roadburner,"Since the weather has improved I've been driving the 2002 and 318ti on a more regular basis. For me it is interesting and fun to experience the entry level Bimmers of 40 and 20 years ago.

My first BMW was a 1973 Bavaria 3.0 that my girlfriend-now wife of 29 years-found for me back in 1983, so when I bought the '02 by accident(long story) on eBay in 2008 it really was like going home again. The 2002 is lightweight yet feels solid; all the controls are reasonably direct and the 2 liter four does it's best- but with only 100 bhp it can only do so much. Aside from an Alpine AM/FM/CD?Sirius XM head unit all the modifications on my car are period correct-E21 Recaros, Weber 32/36, Delta CD ignition, Bosch Red Coil, Bilstein HDs-so the original character of the car shines through. Even with a direct top gear it easily cruises at 80+. Grip is good but body roll can be unsettling to those used to modern levels of roll stiffness. Still, I could easily see myself using a 1973 tii(with a five speed retrofit, rotary A/C compressor, and a decent head unit/speakers) as a daily driver. No, an E10 is most definitely not for everyone, but for those it speaks to, it is a revelation.

I consider the E36/5 ti to be ""The Last '02"" since it was the final BMW four seat coupe fitted with a semi-trailing arm suspension and a naturally aspirated four cylinder. Unlike the 2002, the ti is much more suitable to use as an entertaining(and economical) daily driver. It has a great HVAC system, adequate power(with a Turner/Conforti chip, at any rate), ABS, and front airbags. The only things I really miss(besides 100 extra bhp) are heated seats and wheel mounted audio controls. It weighs in some 550 pounds less than a 228i- and is 10 inches shorter. When BMW Individual was building my Club Sports they tried to make me take the ""optional"" sunroof but my salesperson stepped up and thus my car was built without a hole in the roof. For me, the car is just about perfect; light, nimble, and a ball to drive. The M42 engine does not suffer lazy driving; if you don't like keeping an engine ""on the boil"" than this definitely isn't your car. And on a winding road what shines through is the car's lack of mass. I've been reading how Mazda's new Miata will weigh close to what a 1994 Miata weighed. It would be nice if BMW started making weight reduction more of a priority. Speaking of vehicle weight, did you know that US safety standards require that the front airbags, side curtain airbags, and interior be designed to protect an unbelted 160 pound male? That's ridiculous, every state has a mandatory seat belt law, so safety systems should be engineered to protect properly restrained occupants. I'd think that would allow a significant reduction in weight and complexity. And anyway, at some point we need to let the Law of Natural Selection take its course."
1919,"March 23, 2015 11:57AM",m6user,"I've always considered ELLPS to mean a luxury automaker's entry level car in the performance category, not what is entry level dollarwise for someone's pocketbook. How could anyone possibly define that?"
1920,"March 23, 2015 12:22PM",markcincinnati,"$45K UPPER limit for ELLPS? I would think that the number $45 is closer to the lower limit. If we're going to say that the car should have a STARTING price of $X, well there are a lot of cars that virtually no one buys that do indeed start at $38,995, but typically go out the door at least at $5K-$8K more.

I would think we're talking about a particular family of vehicles and that if we really mean LPS (as part of the acronym ELLPS), well you are indeed speaking of the entire family of 3 series from the lowest MSRP version (totally stripped, but, virtually never sold that way) all the way to the fully loaded M3. Where else would you put the M3 if not ELLPS? And, for that matter where would you put the ""typical"" 335 if not ELLPS, it certainly isn't going to fit in with the LPS cars (where the 5 series family inhabits).

$45K - $65K does cover about the widest range for all the cars that are generally considered in the ELLPS family. The thing that seems likely to make the number beginning with the ""$4"" as the bottom line number is the inclusion of the L & P, there are plenty of ""S"" (sedans) out there that can be had for $45K at the upper limit, but they are generally not going to be invited into the ""LP"" club. I would assume that Cadillac actually would begrudge a Regal (a Regal GS) the key to the ELLPS washroom, if the comparison is between the Regal and the ATS. Cadillac probably wants the ATS (all variants) in the ELLPS class and the CTS in the LPS class these days. Buick, based on the test reports of the LSS (Luxury Sport Sedan) Regal GS (starting at $40,195), I would think the Regal ""family"" can probably qualify. Where it becomes a bit dicey is that the bottom of the line model probably would be considered to be quite a bit less full of the ""P"" and the ""S"" of the bottom of the line ATS. And the middle child ATS can easily swim upstream to an MSRP of $55K+ without breaking a sweat.

The point, to repeat, is that the EL apparently seems, more than anything else, to represent the size of the vehicle; but the LP seems to classify the vehicle based on both luxury content and performance abilities. The range, I would think doesn't top out at $45K, frankly it probably starts north of $40K and keeps on going well into the $60's and as long as they are utilizing the same underwear (thinking of the base 3 series BMW at the bottom and the M3 at the top), going all the way into the $70s certainly isn't that much of a stretch.

This is the best range of cars, features and costs there is, methinks.

I'm just not interested in an Impala or a Malibu, no matter how tarted up it gets (but I think they are styled pretty nicely these days.)"
1921,"March 23, 2015 1:06PM",qbrozen,"i really think you gotta have that base price exclude any variants. An m3 does not belong here, IMHO. It is far from ""entry level."" So, for example, you could include both the 320 and 328 because, per my own made up criteria above, they both fall under the $40k base price cap. And by that same reasoning, you can exclude smaller top-spec cars such as the CLA AMG and S3.

I mean, we aren't talking option packages here. These are different models with their own base prices."
1922,"March 23, 2015 1:06PM",stickguy,"Dino, I think that as some of the old time models ""grew up"" (outgrew the segment?) the smaller models came in underneath to replace them. Pretty sure that an A3 is roughly the size (and mission) of the A4 from a couple of generations ago. And would not be surprised if the ILX is close to the original TSX. BMW though has not (as far as I recall) grown the 3 as much, but they are sliding the 2 in that slot, just not a 4 door."
1923,"March 23, 2015 1:14PM",dino001,"Oh yes, they did. Quite a bit. Current 3-series is much bigger than mine, which in turn was much bigger then previous one. 15 years ago the 5-series was EPA classified as ""compact"". Today, it would be hard to classify the 3 series as such."
1924,"March 23, 2015 1:29PM",stickguy,"Good to know. I knew it did creep up, but did not realize it was that much.

same thing in the normal sedan class. A Civic today is the size of an Accord from a few generations ago."
1925,"March 23, 2015 1:57PM",markcincinnati,"My buddy has a very nice, well equipped BMW 5 series (circa 2003). It is probably equal to or maybe even a tiny bit smaller than a current 3 series.

Where do the ""more expensive"" versions of a model go if not here -- a 335 or an S4 are certainly very very similar, dimension wise to the 3XX and A4 variant from whose loins they sprung, eh?

EL is, today, a size or internal designation (not price); LPS indicates Luxury (which adds cost and sometimes great cost) and Performance (which adds costs and sometimes ooober cost). I cross shopped an A4 Prestige with most options with an S4 Premium+ with three options, because they were ""within reach"" of each other financially. I did not cross shop a maxed out A4 Sline with an RS5 (sorry there is no RS4), but had there been one to choose from, I presume I would still have considered the RS4 as an ELLPS since there is no way someone would confuse it with an A6, S6 or RS6 (or RS7 in the case of this line, since the RS6 isn't imported to the US).

The sales rep I deal with told me he had ""quite a lot"" of S4's coming off lease (that would be the ones prior to the V6 supercharged version, i.e, V8's) and that a number of these customers just couldn't fathom getting an A5 class without a V8, so they went with an RS5 rather than sticking with an S5.

In this class of cars, I think folks look at the size of the vehicle and determine if ""this is the size car I see myself driving"", then they begin with packages, options and accessories until they have the car customized to their liking.

A fully optioned A4 2.0T Prestige with optional features is very close in price to a somewhat less decked out S4, hence my consideration of both. I assume BMW shoppers do the same thing -- they go in for the 328 and trick one out with the option sheet and then test drive a 335 with a few less options and say, ""I'm going to stick with the EL (size) but forego a bit of L for a dose of P in my 3 series Sedan. Happens all the time.

My wife -- set on a Q5 3.0T Premium Plus with about 4 additional options -- test drove an SQ5.

Katie, bar the door -- the 3.0T was super nice -- but the Performance of the SQ was intoxicating.

She did not, however, cross shop with a Q7 or a Q3 -- she wanted the size first, performance second and luxury third. Some folks probably switch second and third -- but there is a cost regardless.

Know too, that some folks (my wife included) checked out the Q5 2.0T first and was ""this close"" to the buy, until she test drove the 3.0T and was ""this close"" until she test drove the SQ, and so it goes.

We choose not to afford a Macaan Turbo (which was close to $90K comparably equipped), but within the family, the choice was Q5 2.0T all the way to the SQ5 with the OMG engine."
1926,"March 23, 2015 2:20PM",qbrozen,"I wholeheartedly disagree. An entry-level job is salary-dependent, as is an entry-level house. Why should an entry-level vehicle not follow suit? If the grouping were dependent on size, the title would use car size classification and it would be called ""Compact Luxury Performance Sedans."""
1927,"March 23, 2015 2:29PM",stickguy,"I am with Q on this. To me, the EL is absolutely cost-dependent."

The only exception I can think of would be in hobby or leisure activity, where it would mean novice, or begginer. In vehicles, M3 or S4 is not entry level in anything. It is compact, or not large, but certainly not entry level. Perhaps in some rich exclusive country club, it could, when they would need somebody else vouch for me in my lowly 328, but a M3 owner may be let in without an usher escort watching the silverware..."
1930,"March 23, 2015 4:29PM",markcincinnati,"Perhaps these cars that we talk about that are in this broad broad category should be called Compact LPS, but also it might make sense to call them mid-size? Entry level and the LP designation if price is the current meaning of EL would seem to be an oxymoron -- and, if price is the meaning of EL, today, where do A3's, to name one, go? Do we ""rationalize"" the naming according to price? The Audi lineup (to name the one I am most familiar with) is A3 (and Q3), A4/A5 (and Q5), A6/A7 (and Q7). The characteristics of these that stands out first is size -- and as the cars get larger, in the progression the price does indeed escalate. But, prior to the current A3, the Audi A4/A5/S4/S5/RS5 were the ""entry level"" cars in the line. They were of a common, more or less, wheelbase length and the other notable characteristics that shared the theme were length and width -- size.

The part that conveys the cost factor is the amount of the content of Land P and a ""certain something"" that somehow we all understand, but like the word ""quality"" is a bit more difficult to define. A Chevy with a 110"" wheelbase is not a member of the ELLPS club. A BMW 3 series, no matter how tarted up or down, however, is.

If the bothersome two letters are EL, well that is beyond our capabilities to modify. These are smaller LPS cars, and generally they cost less than their LPS counter parts. That, I think, is why a strippie 3 and a fully loaded 335 are both ELLPS cars."
1931,"March 23, 2015 4:51PM",roadburner,I know of at least one Bavaria with an S38 motor from an E28 M5 under the hood...

1933,"March 23, 2015 8:00PM",nyccarguy,"I agree that entry level definitely has to meet a price point. Problem is that there is way too much over lapping within the respective companies. The ""entry level"" price points vary as well. Yes there is a big difference between the meat of this market of $35K - $50K on paper. You have to factor in the fact that the majority of these cars are leased. So many times people don't see the difference of a few thousand dollars by looking at the total cost of the lease , but rather as an extra $30, $40, $50 etc per month.

The category is bigger and better than ever.

1935,"March 23, 2015 8:27PM",nyccarguy,Done
1936,"March 24, 2015 7:41AM",breld,"So Bradd - only the upper model of the TLX makes the cut? Just curious.

And I don't know about the CTS - it's always straddled the line between the entry-level (however we may define it) and the ""next level"" - earning comparisons to both a 3-series and the 5. With the intro of the ATS, I'd propose the CTS has been placed firmly into the 5, A6, E-class category."
1937,"March 24, 2015 7:58AM",nyccarguy,"Just my suggestions of course. I feel like Acura's big V6 & slick AWD system do transform the car into a true competitor in the segment.

I agree with you about the CTS, but some of our own have scored these cars for many thousands off sticker which brings them firmly into the price class."
1938,"March 24, 2015 8:10AM",qbrozen,"I used to say that the cheapest model of a brand is all that counted, but I'm thinking differently on that now. I think as long as it hits the pricepoint, it counts. So if that includes more than 1 model from a manufacturer, so be it. Reason being that not all manufacturers have more than 1 model. So just because Volvo doesn't have something smaller than the S60 at the moment, that shouldn't put the others at a disadvantage because they can only put their subcompacts up against it. I also think the price, if positioned properly, excludes the true mid-sizers such as the CTS, 5-series, E-class, and A6."
1939,"March 24, 2015 8:53AM",markcincinnati,"If pricepoint, not size + L+P, is the determining factor for inclusion in this class or nomenclature, can we safely assume that the base price of the base model is ""whatever it is"" and that all modifications to that price based on ""options and packages"" are included in the mix? This, then, means we still have to have some way to account for the ""L"" and ""P"" of the cars (and of course the L+P add both content and cost, even to the base).

Perhaps we can then say that a base 3 series and a fully-optioned 335 are both ELLPS cars because they both start out at a price point of $X.

My car, today, is at the Audi dealer for its 25,000 service interval. Since the dealer has a policy of ""trying"" to match the loaner they provide with the car in for service, I was provided with an S4 for the day. The thing has 1,800 miles on it and is Misano Red Pearl in color (this color is a $500 option); the car also has the B&O sound system upgrade and blind spot monitoring. As a loaner, it also happens to be one equipped with the S-tronic (dual clutch) automatic transmission.

I consider this car below what I would think almost anyone, today, would go for -- but the dealer general manager says no, this car is EXACTLY the base model from a practical perspective, because ""they can't sell"" a version without some level of equipment above ""book"" entry level (what I would call a true stippie).

Indeed, since the car does not have MMI, it will probably only sell because it will -- eventually -- come out of the loaner fleet and be subject to very heavy off MSRP discounting. The ""on the lot"" cars virtually all have MMI+, those that don't were probably ordered specifically without nav with the dealer knowing they would end up in the loaner fleet.

You may or may not chafe at the nearly $3,500 price tag for the MMI+ system, but the take up of that option is, apparently, nearly universal, as is S-Tronic. Yet, sitting on the showroom floor there are a couple of A4's (and one of them, too, is nav-less); I would argue that the base price of these Junior-LPS cars is rarely seen by the actual buyers, since most folks do, typically, go for the ""popular"" option group.

I must note, too, that one reason for the majority going with the popular option groups and/or packages is that the lease calculations FAVOR the high-content variants over the maxed out variants and the strippie variants. Some car-actuary has figured out what will retain the highest residual -- and that, these days, is medium to medium high loaded.

So, if price, not size, is to be the rule of the day, I would have to submit that the price range of cars that fit the bill of ELLPS must be on the order of $39,999 to $69,999; after all it is possible to start out with a BMW 328 ""Walmart"" (or TJ Max) version and max out at a 335ix ""Bespoke"" (so to speak) and spend tens of thousands crossing the chasm from pauper to prince."
1940,"March 24, 2015 10:15AM",dino001,"You forgot about 320i, Mark - even more ""pauper"" version, but according to some here, still spunky enough for their taste. I don't think less than 200 hp is such a problem, if the car is still dynamic enough, so I'd add it. In fact, I'd say that one would be something like ""entry level of entry level"""
1941,"March 24, 2015 10:47AM",qbrozen,"Eh, I really gotta argue for a max on base price, as you said in the first paragraph above, not range of max pricing, be the deciding factor. Otherwise, you open the door to comparison of a CTS Vsport to a base 320i, for example, as 2 ELLPS cars. Whatever it maxes out to should be largely irrelevant since different people want different options. I'm thinking either $40k or $45k as the max base price. The $45k would allow for the 335i and V6 ATS, but it would allow in the S3. The $40k would exclude the S3 but also limit the group to the 4-cyl models of the aforementioned compacts. Either pricepoint excludes the mid-sizers. I could argue either way, honestly."
1942,"March 24, 2015 10:55AM",breld,Makes sense - particularly to the extent AWD or RWD is considered a requirement for the segment.
1943,"March 24, 2015 11:05AM",breld,"As for the criteria for what belongs in this segment (and the fact that there is no hard and fast answer is what makes this a fun discussion), how about the manufacturers' intention?

They make it pretty clear what vehicles are the intended competition, or which ones were used as benchmarks. If those include the 3-series, A4 and/or C-class, I'd say it's in the segment. Whether or not they compete well in the segment is a separate argument."
1944,"March 24, 2015 11:08AM",markcincinnati,"I stand corrected ANY 3XX denomination or derivative that keeps the L+P (and the 320 qualifies) does belong.

Of course, that being said, the range ($) is now slightly broader.

E.G,

320i Sedan
320i xDrive Sedan
328i Sedan
328i xDrive Sedan
328d Sedan
328d xDrive Sedan
335i Sedan
335i xDrive Sedan

Even:

328i xDrive Sports Wagon
328d xDrive Sports Wagon

And:

ActiveHybrid 3

Finally @ the top o' the BMW ELLPS pyramid, the :

M3 Sedan

And we now have rounded out the range of BMW's ELLPS offerings. I suspect we would exclude the X3, since it is technically in the Premium-SUV (or in BMW-speak SAV) class of vehicles, even though it is based on the 3.

The range, then (in base MSRP) is:

$32,950 - $62,000, not that you could with much certainty even find a ""base"" version (without special ordering it).

Just for grins: With most options/packages selected, BUT with zero (no) performance options selected, and keeping the car as a 320i RWD Sedan (not ix as more than half of them are configured) a 320i, optioned thusly has an MSRP of $47,325.

My suspicion is that ""no one"" will option a 320i to $47,325 (and if they do and select ZERO performance options from the order-sheet, that would be even harder to imagine); at that point on the food chain they will, see what could be had with the ""28"" option added and a few of the ""L"" options subtracted; and hey, we're at the dealership anyway, ""ya got any 335's we could test drive?""

Remember -- assuming a Cincinnati BMW dealer speaks for the US dealer body, generally -- most of these cars are leased and when sub-venting comes into play and ""fill-in-the-blank"" luxury and/or performance option or package or both are offered up for another $30 a month, well frugal shoppers turn into fanciful buyers.

I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but my data point would be to note: ""most"" ELLPS shoppers don't go from whatever they used to drive to an ELLPS to give up such things as Bluetooth phone and audio integration, a backup camera and parking sensors and many other ""we take them for granted"" features they had in their nicely equipped Accords, Camrys, Nissans, and Passats just for the snob appeal (if there is any) of driving an Audi, BMW, Lexus or Mercedes.

Case in point, again: The loaner Audi S4 (@$52,200) I have today doesn't have a backup camera, park assist or bluetooth iphone audio integration-- who, in the wide, wide world of sports would spend (or expect to spend) that kind of cheese and not get a backup camera, etc? If my maximum spending ability prevented me from having these ""essentials,"" I assure you I would not look at a German, I'd go Asian or American and probably not be looking at the ELLPS class. Hyundai Genesis anyone?"
1945,"March 24, 2015 11:28AM",qbrozen,"Once again, an M3 is not entry-level by any stretch of the imagination. Nobody is spending $60k thinking ""yeah, this is entry-level.""

And, if it does count, then so do the 5-series, E-class, and even XF."
1946,"March 24, 2015 11:32AM",dino001,"It will be $50K soon. 335i has now starting price of just squeaking below $45K cap, guess what it will be next year. 435 is already above $45K, both coupe and grand coupe. So, unless we disregard naming convention and not recognize 4-series as a separate model, we would have to be prepared for another price escalation. Also C400 is already above $45K.

Based on a quick look, it seems the top versions of those Germans are pricing themselves out of this segment: S4 starts at $48K, S5 is $52K, C400 sedan is $48K, I'm sure the next generation coupe will me more. It's almost like there is forming a separate segment of ""entry level plus luxury sports sedans"", however oxymoronic it sounds, slotting itself in high 40s/low 50s base pricing, with options running up to $70K. One could add R-Design trim of Volvo S60 and ATS 3.6. One could easily make an argument for adding IS350 F and some may want to add top TLX, but I don't know about that. This segment would be distinguished by elevated performance bolted on essentially the same frame of their basic versions. Some additional differentiations by unique colors, interior versions, or other aesthetic treatments will separate those trims further.

Then M3/4 and RS4/5 with (future C AMG) could be called ""high performance compact luxury sports sedans"". ATS-V, if finally released, will surely be aspiring to that club. This segment will mean not only separate special engines, but special solutions related to suspension, weight reduction, chassis design modifications made specifically to support the performance. They'll usually have their own colors, increased comfort features, special interior touches, on much higher level of differentiation then models above. They are in fact, their own models. Call them ""poor man's supercars""."
1947,"March 24, 2015 11:49AM",nyccarguy,"""$69,999""

No way anything with a 6 in front of it should qualify as ""entry level."""
1948,"March 24, 2015 11:59AM",dino001,"I agree. I think it's again in eye of the beholder. Those making middle six-digits (not millionaires, but elite professionals) have a completely different view on entry level luxury than those making $80K-$120K, looking for a premium ride that won't break their finances. Something nice, well above average, with this sporty slant, but within reasonable means. Mark says he can't even imagine lack of backup camera - I don't have it, I do have audible warning system with a colored map picture. I like leather on mine, but wouldn't dismiss those who like that fake stuff - apparently local Mercedes Benz dealers stock only those on their CLA, C, GLA class and even some of E-class. If people buy it, so be it.

I know if I were making twice the money I do today, I'd still be buying compact/midsize, but M4/3 or RS would likely make my list. And in that parallel universe, I'd probably think it's still ""entry level""."

ELLPS:

Entry Level - what is the most basic model that will get you into the brand?

Luxury - in the eye of the beholder, but can the EL be upgraded to an ELL?

Performance Sedan - will it accelerate briskly, stop safely and take a corner without inducing intestinal distress?

So here is my list:

Acura TLX $31,445
Audi A3 $29,900
BMW 320i $32,950

Based on ""history,"" I would keep the A3 and A4 in separate classes of automobiles. And, how is it that both the ATS and CTS can be ELLPS, does that mean the XTS is now the model called LPS?

One point of clarification, my inclusion of cars in this class that can be optioned to numbers deep into the $60K range is NOT the base price. It is the potential price if optioned.

Just like the 320 can have over $15,000 of options added cranking it to just south of $48K, I was suggesting the RANGE from low to high. Most folks won't go for either end, I would assume.

And, each of us brings experience to the buying of cars -- and also to our expectations of features. I cannot see a car without a backup camera, and frankly, I would think top-view is better still. It is a situation where, due to incrementalism, we get a car with, say, back up camera, and then you miss it when it is not there.

Of course, it will be made mandatory by the insurance institute due to the reduction in claims, so you'd better get one sooner rather than later. Who knows: what once were vices will soon become necessities."

1972,"March 24, 2015 6:07PM",tlong,"So adding to the fun, I'd argue that the driven wheels shouldn't matter. If the vehicle performs well and has luxury, the wheels driven are a design issue. It is the performance that counts and there are quite a few vehicles that are fwd that still have good performance - some of them even have better steering feel than the current BMW 3 series which to me is a more important indicator of a sporty vehicle. I'm not usually cornering at .9gs or doing donuts in parking lots, so the driven wheels don't matter to me so much.

As far as entry level, I'd agree with previous posts - it should not be the brand, or the size, it should be *luxury* and *performance*, regardless of those other factors. You could argue that the ILX doesn't have enough luxury and/or performance, and if that is the case (not necessarily agreeing with that; only for argument), then it is the TLX which is the ""ELLPS"" for Acura since it's got a low enough price with the requisite amount of luxury and performance. And I'd also argue that some vehicle from MB or BMW, etc., might not qualify, in spite of the marquee, if the performance and/or luxury are lacking.

I think it is possible to have two models in same category, if they're not differentiated ad much. It does look like C-class is intended to move up, just as CTS. I think A4 is still in the class, both in size and price."
1976,"March 24, 2015 8:11PM",dino001,"I think there is a difference between sportyish mainstream sedan, like Fusion or its plush cousin (more like stepbrother) and 328, A4, or TLX. They may not be world apart, but the separation is distinct."
1977,"March 25, 2015 3:41AM",benjaminh,"The Acura ILX is about 6 inches longer than the Audi A3, and gets to 60 faster than the A3 1.8. At a little after 14 minutes in this long video Alex on Autos measures the acceleration of the ILX at 6.25 0-60, which seems to be about half a second faster than the A3 1.8. At 12:20 he talks about how Acura's 8-speed dual clutch is in some ways superior to that offered in the Audi A3. The Audi obviously has a lot more prestige, and arguably a nicer interior, but the Acura has more standard equipment—like moonroof, heated power seat, rearview camera, pushbutton start, LED headlights, etc. The A3 does have standard leather, while the base ILX has pleather. The A3 also has a better standard stereo. Overall, a comparably equipped A3 1.8 costs maybe about $4-5k more than an ILX, and yet the A3 is slower and gets lower mpg. I may be the only one, but I think if you're including the A3 1.8 then there's a case to be made for the ILX. But if you're starting with the A3 2.0 quattro, I guess that's a different story...."
1978,"March 25, 2015 6:48AM",robr2,"Well based on my criteria of EL - base model that gets you into the brand - and get then be optioned out to give it the L and P, then the CLA is it for MB.

As for the ILX, many would say the inability to have AWD as option precludes it from being an ELLPS. If it were offered with SH-AWD, then it would be the starting point.

Lastly, someone noted that the Fusion and MKZ are based on the European Mondeo. That is incorrect. The current Mondeo was introduced after the Fusion and MKZ. The Mondeo is the exact same car as the Fusion and all 3 were engineered at the same time on a brand new platform."
1979,"March 25, 2015 6:58AM",ab348,The ILX also suffers from the stigma of being perceived by many as a tarted-up Civic. Even though the competing models are also built on existing mainstream platforms. the ILX tends to suffer from that more than most.
1980,"March 25, 2015 7:54AM",qbrozen,"ILX is still part of a luxo brand, so I say it counts regardless of driven wheels. I mean, put it this way... So a FWD A4 is not luxo, but an AWD version that is optioned exactly the same other than the driven wheels is now luxo? Doesn't make sense to me. They will both look and feel exactly the same when cruising down the highway, which is what luxo is all about.

And, as for the ILX being a tarted up Civic... if we use that as criteria, then we'd have to exclude many vehicles from this list. I think about half the luxo market is just tarted up versions of lower-ranking cousins."
1981,"March 25, 2015 8:19AM",venture,"Sort of.

As I understand it, they were engineered together as you said, but the Modeo was delayed being introduced so the Fusion/MKZ were released first.

Why was the Mondeo delayed? Many opinions, but I don't know if anyone other than Ford really knows. The old version of the Mondeo was still selling well in Europe for one thing. Fitting of the 3 cylinder engines and diesel engines all seem to be possibilities. Plus they get the Estate wagon in Europe."
1982,"March 25, 2015 8:28AM",robr2,"The Mondeo was delayed by 3 years to allow Ford to focus on ""balancing the supply and demand of its industrial footprint."" Which means they needed time to consolidate their European factories to stop the flow of red ink.

I also think that it wasn't vital to launch a new Mondeo in 2012. The Mondeo then on sale was only 6 years old and the sales of executive saloons were dropping as CUV's started replacing them."

1984,"March 25, 2015 9:19AM",benjaminh,"It's true that the A3 looks nothing at all like the Golf, while as much as the ILX is restyled and upgraded from the Civic, it has more trouble escaping its sibling.

1988,"March 25, 2015 1:39PM",markcincinnati,"I guess I'm coming 'round to the notion that -- and this is only for example purposes -- both the A3 and A4 could be called ELLPS vehicles (but if I am doing so it is kicking and screaming). This whole thing is so darned subjective though, since I still harbor the notion that (pre A3), the A4 was ELLPS (even though you can crank the S4 to close to $70K) as [because?] the A6 was an LPS.

The ATS is ELLPS as the CTS is [now] LPS; as 3 series is ELLPS as 5 series is LPS.

Now, when the CLA and the A3 came along (and to a certain extent the ILX) we dropped from ""regular fit,"" to ""slim,"" and then finally to ""petite"" (sort of).

To some here EL is an indication of price -- but even those who go to the trouble can find the $ range for a 3 series to be from $32K to $87K.

I have -- historically -- thought of the ELLPS to be mostly a smaller version of the LPS family. Meaning size seems to (in MY mind) still be a better trait than cost. Hell, for the price of my S4, I could have had a Premium+ A6, but the size would clearly differentiate them.

I had not (and mostly still don't) considered the possibility of an A3 or CLA or ILX ever being considered for entry into the ELLPS class -- because of my [possibly wrongheaded] assertion that as nice (or expensive) as the [top o' the line] A3 family (which is called an S3) is, well, it is smaller than the already EL entrant, the A4.

Just as we bumped the CTS to the LPS class and replaced the then ELLPS CTS with the ATS, we may -- soon -- find ourselves needing to do the same thing with the ILX and A3.

Today, however, knowing only what is out there, it doesn't seem [to me] right to have both the ILX and the TLX called ELLPS cars -- just like it doesn't seem right to bracket the CLA and C Class Mercedes as ELLPS cars.

It seems that base price is the hang up -- not actual price -- for we don't seem to argue that a 5 series is an ELLPS anymore than we would argue an A6 or E class is an ELLPS -- we don't because there are model designations downstream (in both size and price).

We have (or the manufacturers have) blurred the lines somewhat -- and it will be another cycle before the cars are again (maybe) rationalized.

An ILX is an Acura.
An ILX is a tarted up Honda
A TLX has much more L + P than the ILX
There is a car model, not just a badge, below the TLX -- and that is the ILX.

Currently the same breakdown is applicable to the A3 and A4 -- but the new A4 will what? Blur the lines further or sharpen the focus, make the two more readily differentiated? Does anyone think the CTS and ATS are the same class of car -- even though the MSRP of the ATS can be made to significantly overlap the MSRP of the CTS.

And so on.

I'll settle -- internally -- for the TLX to be in the same class as the A4, 3 series and C class. I'll accept the A3 and ILX and CLA as similar classified cars. I just find it difficult to have both the A3 and A4 designated as ELLPS cars if the 3 series is in the mix -- the 3 series is marketed against the A4 and C class, not the A3 and ILX class.

I'm more willing to overlook driven wheels -- but my own money would only go for an AWD vehicle knowing what I know and living in the climate I live in. This rules the ILX out -- but keeps the TLX SH-AWD firmly in the fold.

This is getting difficult for me to keep straight.

I love these forums, and I do not want to exclude anyone from them -- but for the sake of birds of a feather, so to speak, when I want to get into one of the forums, I'm not going to venture into the full-sized pickup truck forum since my interests are probably not going to be well served there (and vice versa).

I want to hear (read) your thoughts pertaining to similar vehicles -- I'm going to gravitate toward forums where the participants are interested in and experienced with 3 series, C class, B8 Audis (A4's), TLX's Q50's, etc, etc. I don't have interest in Malibus (not that there is anything wrong with them or those who write about them) or LaCrosses or 300's or 911's or Stingrays (same). Yes a fully tarted up S3 may give rise to a legitimate question about S3's vs A4's or S4's, but generally speaking these are meant to be separate models within the Audi family.

Besides, Audi will soon be rolling out the B9 A4's which will, probably, crank up both the L and the P (and the price) further differentiating the A3 and A4 lines. Mercedes, BMW, Acura, Lexus and Infiniti will almost certainly do the same thing. Well, I think Mercedes already has with the new C class compared to the new CLA class.

In any case, there needs to be a place to go to discuss the cars that would appear to be competitive with each other. Yes, I guess it is possible for someone to shop for an ILX and drive out with a TLX SH-AWD Advance, just as it is possible to look at a 328 and drive out with a 335ix -- but, using the auto magazine comparison test reports as guides, it would be more typical for the A4 to be tested against the 3 series or the C class not the A3 tested against the C class and 3 series, etc.

My head hurts."
1989,"March 25, 2015 3:06PM",stickguy,"so split out compact entry level and mid-size entry level. still within the EL family, but recognizes different size, mission and competitiors.

ILX/A3/CLA/BMW 1 class (when it arrives) would be compacts. Heck, could maybe slot in a top line Jetta! Oh wait, that is an A3... The ATS goes here too.

the ""mid size"" (probably a bad term) are the A4, 3 series (320/328), Volvo, TLX, Infiniti, MB C class, etc.

To further mess with your head, I don't count the HiPo models as entry level. Call them HP compact/mid-size entry level. that would be the S3/S4, M3, etc.

seems logical to me. And I don't see a problem having a couple of groupings in the entry level category. The all fit the basic criteria: A premium model, with sporting pretenses and reasonable performance to back it up, and a decent level of luxury features. Basically a step up from your basic family sedans or small cars.

and yes, just like with compact to midsize family sedans, there is cross-over in content, performance and price. You can load up an A3 to be fancier and more expensive than an A4, and absolutely people can cross-shop them. same with ILX to TLX,. Still within the ELLPS family.

I put the CTS. E class, 5 series, etc. in the next class up. I think you called them LPS (sans EL) which seems quite reasonable.

There is the microcar class below all of that, but the luxo players haven't ventured there yet.

http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/byclass/byEPAclassNF.shtml

The EPA measure cubic footage of the seating areas. Based on that criteria, the Rapide is a subcompact. Aston designed the Rapide with 4 tight seats with a huge console running through the middle of the car. Don't blame the EPA for Aston's poor space utilization.

Many people look at a car, see a big exterior, and expect the interior to be large. Hence, interior volume is what is measured by the EPA."

Do the euro classifications work? Not sure I have time to sift through them all, but specifically dividing C-segment from D-segment. At first glance, it appears to be CLA/A3 in the C-segment and C-class/3-series/A4 in the D-segment.

I think they use whatever ""class"" they can construe to fit their advertising. I recall a discussion about the Ford Taurus which everyone knows is a large family sedan. I believe the EPA had it as a midsize based on interior volume but Ford markets it as a large family sedan. As it should IMO."
2003,"March 26, 2015 11:41AM",tlong,"Let's not forget that size impressions change over time. The Accord was a compact that went to a midsized and then a borderline-large car. The current Civic is larger than earlier Accords. And so Honda has introduced the Fit, which is larger than the first Civics. You can use the same analogy for the Corolla and then Yaris, or the A4 and then the A3, or the C-class and now the CLA.

The vehicles we used to think of as ""entry-level"" have gotten larger and new smaller models have been slotted in below them. In a lot of cases those new models are made more cheaply than the original grown models, so that adds a bit of additional complexity. For example my new '98 A4 was a similar size to the current A3 sedan, but I've sat in the A3 and I would say that the old A4 was a much more luxurious vehicle than the current A3, and it also performed better."

So an argument could be made that they are not ELLPS because they don't have the luxury or performance level expected of the brand. I wasn't impressed with either the CLA or the ILX at the auto show from a luxury viewpoint.
2005,"March 26, 2015 3:22PM",markcincinnati,"My head hurts less, now that we can go back to what I presume was actually intended from the get go:

ELLPS - Compact Sized Premium Sedans with Performance capabilities that are not an afterthought or based on trim, badges, decals and chrome

LPS - Mid Sized Premium Sedans with . . . .

Let's keep the Sub-compacts together but differentiate the ""LPS"" Sub-compacts by virtue of pedigree or genuine Luxury and Performance content. If the A3, despite it pedigree, for instance, can't muster anything else than its name to differentiate itself from a Jetta (or whatever), well it would be left out. I think we're all trying to allow, again for example, the ILX to be in a given class but simultaneously exclude the Civic despite the family resemblance.

SCLPS, EL or C LPS and LPS in short.

I would suspect the 3 series and A4 and C class and ATS buyers are more ""birds of a feather"" as would others of the Sub-compact size be birds of a feather. The price range, for example, of the ELLPS is so very wide, but the ""class"" as noted by the original post still seems to my old-fart's brain to be the one that's ""just right."" We've come full-circle.

2007,"March 26, 2015 8:53PM",markcincinnati,"Coming Soon

Picked up the S4 after the 25K service interval where it received an oil and filter change plus a brake fluid flush and refill. New battery for the smart key and a hand wash and front mat vacuum rounded out the ""no charge"" service. I had a new RED S4 as my loaner for the day. Things are going well, the brakes are said to be at 80% of new.

My rep tells me the new S4 will ""certainly"" have a horsepower and torque jump. The reason? The S4 is ALWAYS more powerful than the top of the line A6 (not S6, 3.0T supercharged A6). The new 2016 A6's on the floor have the same 333HP as my 2014 S4. In my mind, however, it just won't do for the S3 to outgun the S4, just like the S6 ""must"" outgun the S4 and so forth.

So, I'm thinking the new S4 will simply adopt the same motor as is in my wife's SQ5 -- 354HP. Apparently that is a no go -- it won't fit under the hood of the S4. So we're looking at what? 10%; would bump the S4 to 366 HP -- and with a bump in torque to 350, or so, wouldn't that be ""sufficient"" to out gun the S3, be bigger than the A6, but still be outgunned by the S6 and S8, etc.

Well, if my sales rep knows some bump is a certainty, don't you think BMW does too? The 335 is due for what a 15% bump? And so forth?

The horsepower (and torque) ""wars"" continue and continue and continue.

How many speeding tickets does it take before your insurance company dumps you or you end up in jail? Making a lighter A4 line and bumping the power by ""only"" 10% is certainly a recipe for ""license and registration please . . . Mark."" God I hate it when the traffic cop knows you by name.

Can't wait for the new uprated power -- coming soon to a [German] car near you."
2008,"March 27, 2015 5:19AM",graphicguy,"This was a few years ago, but I was doing a little stoplight wars with my (then) relatively new Mustang GT. Not a slow car by any stretch. Until, I got into a little friendly throttle blip war with an F150 in the next lane.

Lite goes green. Throttle mashed, good shift from 1st to 2nd, an even better one from 2nd to 3rd until we both backed off. But, he was 100 feet ahead of me when we did. Ended up he had debadged and chipped what ended up being an F150 Lightning.

From that p;point forward, as long as my vehicles were quick, I was happy.

Loved my time with the Mustang, the S4 and my 335i. Emphasis for me these days is the whole package. If it doesn't go well, if it doesn't handle well, if it's not put together well, if it isn't relatively pain free from a maintenance and reliability standpoint, it's not on my radar."
2009,"March 27, 2015 9:19AM",roadburner,"Agreed; that's what I like about my MS3 it's relatively quick(especially since I boosted the horsepower and removed the ludicrous top speed limiter), handling is very good(if you don't mind the slow in-fast out point and shoot driving style), and it's still a comfortable cruiser. I also like the fact that it is a true sleeper. Right now I'm trying to decide my next car will be a focused track toy or a more luxurious Grand Tourer. In either case it will almost certainly be a RWD coupe with at least 350 bhp and three pedals."
2010,"March 27, 2015 10:45AM",flightnurse,"I think people are missing the point on price, the prices people are quoting is MSRP, who pays MSRP? So a 320i with premium package, Leather, Sport Package and Lighting Package $41,400. Can be had easily for $38,400 and right now BMW has $1,500 debate on cars on the dealers lot, $36,900. I'm sure you can get said 320i for even less then this. So for under$40K you can have a ELPS this is with manual transmission... Lease Payments for said BMW with mim down of about $1,100 for tax's and fee's would be roughly $350/m. Now a 328i with Sport package, Premium package (includes Leather) and lighting package is $45,500 (MSRP) Could be has easily for $40,800 this includes $1,500 rebate BMW has, and I'm sure you could get this price down even more.. With mim down, lease payments would be roughly $375/m

So when you guys are throwing around prices, lets be realistic, who on this board pays MSRP for their cars? No one... Real world data is showing that people are paying a lot less for their cars."
2011,"March 27, 2015 10:51AM",m6user,Nobody is missing the point. Everyone realizes what you're saying but some deals are better than others for a variety of reasons. That's why people use MSRP for reference. It's like using the EPA MPG numbers. Everyone knows that peoples mpg varies some but for comparison purposes the EPA numbers are best to use. There is always somebody that got $10k off or pays close to MSRP for some oddball reason or gets 40mpg in a car rated for 32. Better to deal with verifiable numbers for comparison sake.
2012,"March 27, 2015 12:54PM",qbrozen,"exactly. And deals vary throughout the year. MSRP is the only way that makes consistent sense.

By the way, @markcincinnati, I still think pricing is part of the equation. I'd like a combination of size class and pricing. B-class cars with starting MSRP under $40k, for example."
2013,"March 27, 2015 1:33PM",markcincinnati,"QB: wouldn't that mean that the Audi S4 (not RS) and the BMW 335 (not M) would be ineligible? I know we can (and do) discuss pretty much whatever we want here (within certain parameters) but we would really narrow the category and the forum(s) down quite a bit if we put a cap of $39,999 as a starting point; unless of course you meant the 335 would be allowed in because there are 3 series cars that do fit this criteria.

Thus: a 320 ""invites"" all ""3"" class cars along with it.

I do not have access to ""unlimited"" funds (as a practical matter, few of us do, even the 2%-ers) -- but my search and the folks I know and ""fraternize"" with (middle and upper-middle class earners) typically buy/lease within a 2 class range. Example: my neighbor says he's looking at BMWs. I say ""what model?"" He says, ""probably a 5 series, the 3 is too small, maybe a 7 series, I'll have to see what kind of deal I can get.""

One day, I see what I presume is a new 535ix with dealer plates in his driveway. As I pass, I roll down my window and stop to ask, ""is that the new ride?"" He says, ""they gave it to me for the weekend, I have to take it back Monday, I dunno."" I say, ""you'll really appreciate the X-drive if we have another winter like this one.""

He says, ""no poop?!?"" (not really).

Next time I drive by -- a few days later, I see a new 7 series in the driveway with temp tags on it. When I see him next, I ask him about it. He tells me, ""the lease payment on this car wasn't much more than the payment on the 5 and this thing is loaded -- I couldn't turn it down.""

Now, for all I know he was set on a 7 series all along -- he is a tall drink of water. But I think he was assuming the 5 series would be fine and fit the financial parms he and his wife had set. Well, when for a ""little more"" he could have a 7 series, well it was probably NOT an agonizing decision.

The thing that cracks me up is what ""always"" happens (and if you don't believe me, spend some time on Audiworld's forums): the new fill-in-the-blank is acquired (purchased, financed or leased) and about 15 minutes later, the proud new owner is browsing Tire Rack, APR, (fill in the blank for your brand of LPS car) etc for ""all the stuff"" that this brand new owner will buy to modify his (or her) new ride.

I have seen -- again, over on Audi World -- folks announce the new A4 they've just ordered, then announce that the car is at the dealer, then post picture of the new car (while it is still at the dealership) with the title of the post ""Let the Mods Begin.""

Folks (broad generalization) buy/lease any of these cars that can genuinely and without qualification be in the ""something"" LPS class and then dump another dump-truck of money on aftermarket tires and wheels, engine management chips, pullies, exhaust systems, brakes, lights, spoilers, coil-overs, audio systems, nav systems, headlights, tail-lights, interior treatments, and . . . (the list goes on and on and on -- thank you SEMA).

It seems to me if you have ""graduated"" to the luxury performance sedans (etc), that you can, practically speaking, pretty much afford anything you damn well please.

The wheels and tires alone ""y'all"" spring for on an otherwise very well equipped 335 or Q50 or S4 cost a young fortune -- yet ""y'all"" go ahead and plunk down the forty-nine, eleventy-twelve thousand dollars on the car and then just for grins put on a $2,400 set of rims with $1,200 worth of rubber on them without batting a freakin' eye.

What really cracks me up is the folks who acquire an A4 and then spend thousands on engine, suspension and tire and wheel mods so that they can create what they designate as an AS4 -- when for another $50 a month they could've had an S4 and be done with it (and the warranty would still be in full force, too).

One A4 buyer purchased one without navigation and then worked and worked until he found all of the parts required to retro-fit the Audi OEM nav system into the thing -- talk about costing a fortune. I often wonder, why not buy an A4 and see how much money and sweat it will take to fit the DSG transmission in place of the 8-speed tiptronic.

It ain't the money that compels ""our"" actions in this class of car -- at least as far as the fan site participants are concerned. Some of the aftermarket audio systems, too, cost more than a new 4K 79"" UHDTV.

AMEX - don't leave home without it.

These are LPS cars we're talking about -- within middle and upper middle class lunacy and normalcy you're just gonna have to get rid of the notion of $40K -- it jus' isn't a thing anymore (if it ever was)."
2014,"March 27, 2015 6:56PM",sweendogy,"I like the idea of a bmw that's sporty for under 40k....but el cheapo with auto (which some herd have ) is not it.

Talk lease leader ad deals- guys who get 10-15k of cts - but real world when you need a car you take msrp and subtract an amount- usually 10-% or less depending on car. I love cars- I love cars with passion more. Do you feel the love (tonight?)"
2015,"March 28, 2015 9:00AM",graphicguy,"BMW is all about the lease payment. I was not a typical customer for them, since I don't lease. When I bought my first one, a fair amount of time ago, my sales guy was a little taken aback by me negotiating based on a purchase. He said they always negotiated payment. He's a good guy. Whenever I walk into the dealership, he knows I'm seriously looking and not just kicking tires. We go straight to the ""dealer sheet"", allegedly with his cost and MSRP on it.

Point of all this, you guys are right. The only consistent price point you can depend on is the MSRP. We don't pay that. But, it's the only consistent number you can reliably use, that has no bearing on geography, lease vs buy, demand (or not), etc.

I still say the ""base"" price can't exceed $45K for EL. That means the A3/4 gets in, but the S4 doesn't, for example."
2016,"March 28, 2015 1:02PM",qbrozen,"I could be talked into $45k, which allows the 335i, but not the 335ix. I could go either way, frankly. I think $40k would make more sense after BMW releases a smaller class here in the US to compete with the CLA/A3"
2017,"March 28, 2015 7:44PM",markcincinnati,"What is the issue with the base price? The class of car which means ""who knows"" what the base price will be is what this is all about. The A3 is a sub compact, the A4 is a compact. If this is to be about sub-compacts, well I guess that is OK, but then we would need yet another cubby hole to poke the B8 Audis and the entire lineup of 3's. These are LPS cars -- but a bit smaller. In some instances it is easily possible to have the 3 series priced at more than the 5 series.

Is there a debate about the ""maximum"" MSRP (base) for the full sized LPS's?

It may well be true that a 335 would fit a $45K ceiling (for an RWD only version), but -- according to the BMW dealership here in River City -- over 40%, of all 3 series sold are AWD. And, here in our climate, I was told the number now favors the x - drive versions as the majority sold.

The 3 series -- from bottom to top -- are in the compact class. MSRP ranges from a number beginning with a $3 to a number beginning with a $6.

There are NO 335's with a window sticker under $50K, unless someone has deliberately ordered one totally stripped. There are no S4's under $50K either -- but I have seen S4 manual transmission versions with but one option that squeak by at a hair over $50K.

Likewise, I shopped the IS350 Fsports and they were ALL over $50K (if they were AWD).

We need to talk about either sub-compacts or compacts here. Since the MSRP's (from a practical standpoint) are all over the board, we need to think, for example, 3 series, not 3 series until they exceed $40 or $45K.

Those who lease (apparently the majority) shop mo pay, not MSRP. And those who do buy, well, of course they're welcome too. I am simply arguing to be inclusive.

Spend some time on the Mercedes build your own board and see how quickly the C class heads up up and away. Even the ATS when well equipped goes ballistic with aplomb and ease."
2018,"March 28, 2015 9:10PM",nyccarguy,I think the 320i is going to be a tremendous value once they start coming off lease ans selling as CPO BMWs for the low to mid $20K.
2019,"March 29, 2015 8:15AM",dino001,"Mark, I think it seems there is a vantage point gap between you and some other guys here. You seem to be getting mostly top of the line, or at least well into the options, whereas a lot if other guys seem to be fishing in much less equipped ponds and get freaked out by anything more than 50 on the sticker. They said so repeatedly. It may be because they live by their memories (what it used to cost), or perhaps by simply how much they could afford. For myself, I don't look at cars at their base. If I can't afford its mid-to-high option version, the car is not for me. I see no point is a stripper, but I understand why somebody may actually go for it. But that vantage point difference is very real. I generally agree with inclusion of 335 in this class, but it barely squeaks into. S4 used to be IMHO above 335, but that was before they eliminated V6 version of A4 and S4 took its place, giving space to RS4/5. I totally disagree on M or RS. There is absolutely NOTHING entry level about it, from pricing, to chassis, to engineering. ZERO. Other than superficial likeness, those are different cars than their lower cousins, essentially from ground up. Small size? Porsches are even smaller, so what? That's not enough."
2020,"March 29, 2015 8:23AM",qbrozen,"I'm not sure of everything you are trying to say, but it comes down to the same thing some of us have been saying over and over again: ENTRY LEVEL is price-dependent. Something with a base price starting with a 6 is not entry level, no matter what it shares its underpinnings with. And, yes, of course a car can be optioned up with a ridiculous amount of gee-gaws, but that's largely irrelevant to the discussion. You can take a $16k Honda and put $20k of electronics, custom paint, and custom interior on it, but that doesn't change its class. Lipstick on a pig, in other words. Base MSRP provides a consistent basis of comparison."
2021,"March 29, 2015 6:07PM",flightnurse,"Mark every car magazine has disproved this whole ""If you live in snow country, you need AWD"" Car's today and the electronic nannies have helped so much that AWD isn't really needed, plus these same magazines have shown how people have a false sense of security with these cars."
2022,"March 29, 2015 6:19PM",Michaell,"Yeah but the magazines don't buy cars. My wife will not have a car without AWD here in Colorado even though we really only ""need"" it about 10-15 days per year."
2023,"March 29, 2015 9:15PM",markcincinnati,"Yeah but the magazines don't buy cars. My wife will not have a car without AWD here in Colorado even though we really only ""need"" it about 10-15 days per year. 

Here's ""a"" thing -- not the thing, a thing: The list of BRANDs we discuss here (and elsewhere) that do not offer AWD versions of their models has diminished to an incredibly small number. Perception is reality is the phrase we live by, even if we don't always agree. The perception is that the higher performing models from Audi, BMW and Mercedes (just to name the Germans for an example) now offer AWD virtually if not literally and I think we're closing in on literally, across their entire lines. Porsche, clearly not an LPS generally speaking, has 20 different cars for sale all called 911's -- I believe they are all offered with AWD. And, often the ones (of any ilk, brand or type) that achieve the most ""wins"" are the AWD models.

But, even if that were not true -- what really matters is what people buy. Pull into a parking lot of a high zoot country club and look at the trunk emblems on the carefully parked high buck LPS (or, of you ike ELLPS) cars -- the majority of them will be xdrive, CTS or ATS4's, or quattros or four-matics or AWD badged in some way.

Let's assume that my wife and your wife, knowing that they can only actually REQUIRE AWD for about 2-5 days per year (for go power in snow); and that they could probably go if they would use winter tires with FWD or RWD, just fine, were asked if they would give up AWD. I am positive the answer from my wife would be, ""don't take away my AWD.""

The perception and the sales have been pointing to AWD, automatic transmissions, not naturally aspirated engines, more than 6 speeds in the transmission (or at the very least, nothing less than 6 speeds) and more and more electronic driving aids.

Entry level may have started off as meaning ""cheaper versions"" of higher line cars from a given mfg. And, as a practical matter, at base, no options, that is, MSRP, that is still true. But I am today convinced (by virtue of what the dealer folks tell me) that the only reason for a given BASE MSRP is the tv commercial and the lease price. And, even that is changing -- now the tv ads tout the car that is being advertised for $X pre month is ""nicely equipped"" -- if you hit the pause button and read the fine print, the cars being advertised are more and more likely to no longer be base models. Unless mandated to do so, you would be hard pressed to even find a base price model at a dealership.

The reason is no one will buy one of this class of car NEW at least without the ""premium"" package on it, so dealers stock their lots -- since most Americans won't orders cars, cause they have to have it today -- with cars that are popularly equipped. This translates to a lot, but not all, of the options on the check sheet.

I spoke to a German dealer rep who thought we (Americans) were crazy for ""always"" putting sunroofs in our cars since those of us who have them rarely, if ever, open them. Big bucks for a vestigial options. It is virtually impossible to get a German car sans sunroof -- and if you try, well you for sure throw yourself into a class of car that the leasing organizations will not sub-vent, because they have the experience with a market that won't buy a car that doesn't have a sunroof, even if no one ever opens them.

The point of all of this is to say, OK, I'll concede the historical meaning of ELLPS meant ""low cost"" -- but what is now ELLPS, then would have to be A3's, but NOT A4's (the B9's will certainly cost more than the B8's, even at base, strippie levels.) Then we need somewhere to put the A4's, 3 series and C class's -- to say nothing of some of the other ""premium"" offerings from Asia and America.

If you agree about the use of the term Entry Level as not necessarily being about $, the M3, for instance is the Entry Level M car -- and, at this point in time, there is no Entry Level RS car, unless you accept that Audi has chosen for whatever reason to only offer an RS4 as a ""station wagon"" -- and one, even at that, that cannot be had in the US.

We can go on about our business, and as long as we do not violate the terms of use of the Edmunds organization, who cares if we agree or disagree or agree to disagree about size or base MSRP.

I'm interested in speaking with, in print, folks who love (or at least like) luxury performance sedans -- and, here, luxury performance sedans that are compacts -- thus ruling out their big brothers and sisters, the 5's, E's, etc.

Even then, if someone is shopping for a 5 and goes with a 3 or a 7, I would find their thoughts and comments of interest.

If LPS is supposed to include ""I wish I was an LPS car"" type of vehicle, I'm not interested so much.

I think the VW CC or Passat are good cars -- interesting cars, perhaps even desirable cars, but today I don't think they are members of the LPS club. But they certainly are priced lower, for the most part. It's just they aren't LPS class cars. If we're looking to discuss them, we all know where to go.

The reason for the A3 and CLA (for example)? According to the two dealers I spoke with, the reason for these new, less expensive models is that the ELLPS variants typically sell for a number beginning with either a high four number or a low five number -- these new models allow folks who want to be in the Mercedes family to join for $37,500 rather than $57,500 -- and hopefully will trade UP next time.

I believe Mercedes is just following the Alfred P Sloan model -- start them out with a Chevy and hopefully they'll eventually buy a Cadillac. Start them out with a CLA and maybe someday they'll be back for an S Class.

It could work.

I think entry level is a name that needs some rethinking. The lower cost of the ELLPS vs the LPS is, apparently, a function of the wheelbase, length overall and width of the model -- back to the EPA classification, if you will."
2024,"March 29, 2015 9:47PM",m6user,"""these new models allow folks who want to be in the Mercedes family to join for $37,500 rather than $57,500 -- and hopefully will trade UP next time.""

That's exactly what an ""entry"" level car is. ELLPS is the lowest price performance sedan of a given maker. If a car qualifies all the alphas then it should be included. I don't personally see the CLA, ILX and 320 for examples as performance sedans even though they are entry level luxury."
2025,"March 30, 2015 5:55AM",graphicguy,"All good points. The starting numbers, for all cars, are now in the high teens. Those prices are populated by the Fiat 500, Kia Soul, Hyundai Accent, Cruise, Fiesta, etc. Most, if not all, sacrifice one or the other portions or power, refinement, quality of materials, material quality, etc. Sometimes sacrificing a lot of everything. That's how they get to those price points.

Some manufacutrer have become quite clever. They'll wrap their ""cheap"" cars in innovative styles. Look close enough, and it's hard to mask the underlying cost cutting.

When you move up that ladder, into the Civics or Accords, Corollas or Camry, Fusion, Malibu, Mazda 3 or 6, etc., you crack that $25K price, with the best of them hitting the low $30s.

From my perception, that's where the A3, CLA, 320i, ILX, probably a 2.5L ATS want to play (I suppose you can throw the Infiniti G in there, but that's pretty old these days). Not the best those brands can do, but it gets you in the door of the brand. 3 year lease is over, You think, I'm making a little more money, and boy was that C Class ever sexy looking when I was last in the showroom and hopefully, if you had a good experience with the previous car, you're driving off in a $45K C Class, or A4, or 328, loaded up TLX, or an ATS with the better drivetrain, with more options.

All of a sudden, all those promises of having a good portfolio and compound interest are starting to bear fruit. Now, you're in the $50K-$60K bracket. Now, you're looking at E Class, A6, CTS. You wouldn't dream of sullying your driveway with an Impala (even though it's every bit as good as an XTS).

Mark, you're right. That's what Sloan started, and the hope for all these brands, how they want to ""hook"" you from the start.

Where Mercedes and BMW seem to have an advantage, they've positioned themselves as aspirational brands. Cadillac used to be there. I think some of that is still there. Their missteps have cost them some of that, though. I've not driven an A3. But, I have driven an S3. Fun car. To live with it everyday? Probably wouldn't be my choice. Test drove a CLA. That is not a good car. An Accord is better in every way. But, you have a Mercedes, an aspirational brand. And, you're in it for about the price of a loaded Accord.

I'll accept that the 320i is a good car based in FN's reports. But, I've only driven one when my sister was shopping them (she ended up with a C Class.......BECAUSE IT WAS A MERCEDES...320i was the better car, IMHO). Audi wasn't on her radar based on my experience with them.

Audi and Acura are FWD architectures. Today, these platforms are SO GOOD, it really doesn't matter to me. I know for many of you, it does. The Mercedes, Cadillac (ATS/CTS) are RWD platforms. But, Mercedes is bringing their FWD platform here, too.

What does any of this have to do with ELLPS? Probably not diddly....except everyone in here will be in the Audi, Acura, Cadillac, BMW, Mercedes showrooms sometime in the next 24 months....guaranteed."
2026,"March 30, 2015 6:16AM",stickguy,Lots of us open the moonroof all the time. And many people that don't still open the shade to get more light in. Especially important in the typical German black cave interior!
2027,"March 30, 2015 6:51AM",qbrozen,"Started off as and still is the ""cheaper version."" However, that doesn't necessarily mean no options. That's why I've been stressing BASE MSRP. I absolutely concede that some luxury options are almost a necessity to make it feel like a luxury car. The only thing the limit on base msrp does is exclude other models that start much higher, such as the M, AMG, S, or V examples.

So, like I said earlier, the only reason I'm thinking the cutoff is cost, not size, is to allow BMW and Caddy to play here on equal ground. I mean, I suppose its not unrealistic to compare a 328 to an A3, but then folks would be arguing those two don't directly compete. Then we have to say ""ah, but you can't discuss the A4 because its not the entry-level model."" It just makes things more confusing.

2028,"March 30, 2015 7:18AM",stickguy,"Q nailed it. These are the models to get the budget challenged into the category/brand. Not the highest performance or most luxurious, but with reasonable quantities of both. Size is not that important. Nor is drivetrain configuration. Badge and price are."
2029,"March 30, 2015 7:23AM",stickguy,"My son is a good example. First job, new car, tight finances. He got a Jetta. SE. Wanted a GLI, but got in fold and hooked on German cars. Already planning next one. Drools on an S3. Will probably settle for an A3. After that, will depend on how his budget (and family if one comes along) grows! But he does aspire to move up the ladder."
2030,"March 30, 2015 8:00AM",Michaell,"Other than AWD and a few extra HP, what's the difference between the GLI and the A3?"
2031,"March 30, 2015 9:03AM",m6user,"Nicer interior, better warranty, dealer experience and luxury brand. For a young guy, pulling up to pick up your date in an Audi versus a Vdub could be a game changer. LOL."
2032,"March 30, 2015 9:05AM",roadburner,"Back to AWD, I can understand why you might want one in the mountains or the Northeast; but even in my neck of the woods people spring for AWD.(the reason we have a Jeep and and an X3 truck is because our 1500' gravel driveway rarely sees a plow- but note that my Wrangler made it through over 18"" of snow in 2WD thanks to BFG All Terrain KO tires with the Severe Snow rating).

What I find to be incredibly pathetic are the hopelessly inept souls who say that they can't own a RWD car because they need a vehicle that they can drive in the rain.
What they really need is their license pulled in exchange for a handful of bus tokens..."
2033,"March 30, 2015 9:20AM",stickguy,"I was going to say ""4 rings"". Though in a performance oriented car, the AWD can come in handy (he does live up in a heavy snow area in upstate NY). Something like a GLI where you are getting into low profile performance tires would likely require snow tires, and he has no place to keep those off-season."
2034,"March 30, 2015 9:45AM",m6user,"Yeah, well since he said ""besides AWD and a few extra HP"" I didn't address the AWD part. But that would be a large factor in that neck of the woods.

As far as people wanting AWD. A lot of people had RWD cars when they were younger and they remember the horrible situations in snow covered streets where they just spun and the rear end kicked out all over the place(I had a 1980 Camaro, loved it but not in the snow) because that was before better all-season tires, ABS, traction control, etc. And after FWD cars took over the availability of RWD mainstream cars is somewhat limited. A lot of people haven't driven a RWD car since then, so the memories are their perception."
2035,"March 30, 2015 10:04AM",robr2,"Perhaps the young man should reevaluate his date if that's what the measure she uses....

...and that brings us back to the reason the vast majority of these ELLPS' are sold - prestige and the look at me factor."
2036,"March 30, 2015 10:39AM",Mr_Shiftright,"Any AWD system can be completed neutralized by the wrong tires and the wrong driver.

These are, after all, the two things that actually keep a car on the road.

Another factor is that many AWD sedans don't offer any greater ground clearance, so deep snow is going to defeat you anyway."
2037,"March 30, 2015 10:39AM",nyccarguy,"So many times I hear someone say: ""my car stinks in the snow or my car drives terribly in the snow."" For the longest time I responded with: ""its probably not your car that drives terribly in the snow, if equipped with a proper set of winter tires you should have no problems."" That usually got the ""deer in the headlights stare"" at which point I would just say: ""You are right. you need AWD or 4WD."""
2038,"March 30, 2015 10:48AM",roadburner,"Yep- the ""wearers."""
2039,"March 30, 2015 10:56AM",m6user,"If given the choice of driving the same exact vehicle with the same exact tires in a winter snowstorm, I would choose the AWD vehicle every time. People always say ""well if you used the right tires and drove like me you would have no issues"". Actually getting tired of hearing that. And there is a big difference between ""need"" and ""nice to have"". Do I need AWD in the winter around Chicago?.....not really. Is it very nice to have in certain situations where you need you need to get out of someone else's way or get going from a light in slippery conditions? Yes, it is very nice to have. Of course, I can get around without AWD as I occasionally drive my RWD v-8 truck in the snow but it isn't a lot of fun."
2040,"March 30, 2015 11:09AM",Mr_Shiftright,"Well that's an argument that isn't as strong as it first sounds because invariably over-confidence in AWD often leads to mishaps. If you doubt this, I invite you to talk to any tow truck driver who operates in or near a popular ski area. If nothing else, and it doesn't convince you, you'll get some entertaining stories.

No matter how you cut it, your car is kept on the road by four small patches of rubber--if that rubber has no grip, it woudln't matter if you had ten-wheel drive. Same with mud, or sand.

So my advice to anyone with AWD is to choose your battles wisely, and if you do, then you'll have the edge--all things being equal."
2041,"March 30, 2015 11:18AM",nyccarguy,"I have got to tell you, the more I think about it, the more I like the Audi S3 Premium Plus. Look at the standard features you get:

2.0 Liter Turbo DOHC 4cyl
292 hp - 280lb/ft torque
6 Speed DSG
Quattro AWD
0 - 60 mph 4.7 sec (audi website)
Dual Zone Climate Control
Panorama Roof
Heated Seats
Xenon Headlights
Leather Surfaces
Bluetooth

All this for a starting MSRP of $41,100"
2042,"March 30, 2015 11:44AM",Michaell,"Only if the lady in question is a snob .. she might prefer the VW due to the IQ of the owner, understanding the value..."
2043,"March 30, 2015 11:46AM",Michaell,And I'd rather get a Golf R - all of the above (I think) and the practicality of a hatch!
2044,"March 30, 2015 11:49AM",m6user,"""Well that's an argument that isn't as strong as it first sounds because invariably over-confidence in AWD often leads to mishaps.""

OMG, really? Never heard that one before. I see yahoos all the time thinking they can drive faster because of AWD. Sorry, but I'm not one of them. Didn't feel I had to put that qualifier in the argument. OK, same vehicle, same tires, same careful driving then. AWD is easier to get around in heavy snow and slippery conditions given the same type of driving. Does it allow one to drive like a maniac. Absolutely not.

And invariably means that it will always happen sooner or later right? Don't think you can say that about all drivers."
2045,"March 30, 2015 11:51AM",m6user,That does seem to be a nice price for the S3. Is that price good for all that equip??
2046,"March 30, 2015 12:24PM",stickguy,"Bradd, from reading about the ride on that, you might not enjoy it on the I95 bomb craters very much."
2047,"March 30, 2015 12:25PM",stickguy,"AWD is not just snow. Vs. FWD, it can also give better handling and balance on wet roads. And dry. The WRX is AWD for a reason!"
2048,"March 30, 2015 12:26PM",roadburner,You nailed it!
2049,"March 30, 2015 1:30PM",robr2,Because it's a Subaru and the purists would have a conniption if it were anything else!!
